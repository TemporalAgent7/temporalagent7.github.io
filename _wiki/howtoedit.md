The source of truth for all of the site content is [its GitHub repo](https://github.com/TemporalAgent7/temporalagent7.github.io). All the wiki pages are stored as Markdown.

You can use the normal Git process for submitting changes (fork the repo, create a branch, make all the changes you want and submit a PR).

### Thank you!
