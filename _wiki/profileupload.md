## How to upload your profile via the in-game support menu

1. Click on the icon next to your name in the upper-left corner, then open the Options (2nd) tab and click on the Support (green) button
2. This will open your mail client
3. (Important‚ùó) In the `To` field, delete `startreklegends@tiltingpoint.com` and replace it with `legends@datacore.app`
4. Replace the `Subject` with your captain name (or whatever name you want to use for sharing)
5. (Optional) Type the word `full` somewhere in the mail body if you want to include your stats / items as well
6. After sending the email you will get a reply in a few minutes (assuming everything works) with a link to your profile that you can share here or with your alliance / friends.

There is no private information included in the profile; see the source code for the mail processor [here](https://github.com/TemporalAgent7/legends-mailbot) - the information included in the saved profile is your level, gears, particles, characters and mission status.

## How to upload your profile from a mac computer

On the mac computer where you are playing the game open this page in a browser: https://legends.datacore.app/tools.

Then drag&drop your saved game onto the box and click on the Share profile button. The saved game can be found at `/Users/[you]]/Library/Containers/com.tiltingpoint.startrek/Data/Library/Preferences/com.tiltingpoint.startrek.plist` on your mac.
