I'm retiring from the game as it's getting too boring and uninteresting. I'll keep the site and bot alive for a few months but won't be updating the data; if you want to take over that, please let me know (you need a mac, a Windows PC and some tech know-how).

All the code that powers the bot and website is opensource:
- [Website](https://github.com/TemporalAgent7/LegendsDataCore)
- [Website Server](https://github.com/TemporalAgent7/legends-server)
- [Discord Bot](https://github.com/TemporalAgent7/legendsbot)
- [MailBot](https://github.com/TemporalAgent7/legends-mailbot)

## Contact

The easiest way to get in touch is by opening issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/TemporalAgent7/LegendsDataCore/issues). You can also ping TemporalAgent7 on the [Official Game Discord](https://discord.gg/SzkVaFJCa5).
