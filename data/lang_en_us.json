With any luck it might tell us more about this damn dimension!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle01_01":"Have you found the human whose signal we intercepted?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle01_02":"No. The commander won’t be pleased. Wait.. Over there! Federation dogs!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle01_03":"The commander will be happier when we bring her prisoners of war! Weapons ready!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle01_post_01":"Romulans! If they are searching for Captain Kirk, he is in grave danger.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle01_post_02":"First time I’ve ever seen one. There’s been no contact with them since the war ended a century ago.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle01_post_03":"Count yourself lucky. My <i>Enterprise</i> was the first to see them since then. I wish they’d kept their distance.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle02_01":"My tricorder shows a storm blowing in. We’d better move quickly.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle02_02":"How do you know Spock, anyway? Were you students together at the Vulcan science academy?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle02_03":"We're siblings, Doctor. And before you ask, I was adopted.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle02_04":"Hmphh. You do seem a little green-blooded…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle03_01":"Stop! This is as far as you go.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle03_02":"What have you done with Captain Kirk?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle03_03":"The captain is in very good hands. But it is a pity you’ll never see him again.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle03_post_01":"Well... sounds like he's alive, at least.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle03_post_02":"But for how long, in Romulan hands? We must find him!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle03_post_03":"<i>Spock to <i>Artemis</i> away team. I must commend your efforts. You’ve handled the situation with near Vulcan precision.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle03_post_04":"<i>Our scans indicate another Romulan encampment within several kilometers of your present position.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_battle03_post_05":"<i>It is likely they are holding Captain Kirk nearby.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_exploration01_01":"I’m detecting a Starfleet beacon from within that shuttle...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_exploration01_02":"No sign of Jim. He must still be out there. We should check the shuttlecraft’s logs.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_exploration01_03":"We should proceed with caution and scan the area. There may be more Romulans cloaked nearby.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Logs show Captain Kirk was the pilot.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_exploration01_reaction01_02":"No sign of where he went from here, but they indicate were weapons fired before the shuttle landed.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_exploration01_reaction01_03":"There shall be no sign of you, either!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_exploration01_reaction02_01":"I’m detecting more Romulans approaching. Get ready to defend yourselves!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_story01_01":"<i>Ah, Doctor McCoy. A pleasure to hear your voice. And you as well, Michael, after all this time.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_story01_02":"Wait...  you two know each other? How?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_story01_03":"<i>A story for another time.  Unfortunately, Captain Kirk is missing. The shuttle he was aboard has vanished.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_story01_04":"<i>Long range scans detect a Federation distress signal on Trigon VII, the planet you are orbiting... It could be from the captain.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_story01_05":"<i>Your assistance in locating him would be appreciated. <i>Enterprise</i> out.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_story01_06":"Was that really him? Was it Spock?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_story01_07":"No… His resonance signature is consistent with the Nexus. The real Spock is still out there, somewhere…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m1_story01_08":"Then he is no more than a phantom. Still, we do not know if the Kirk he described is real or not. We should investigate.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle01_01":"You fools run blindly toward your deaths!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle01_02":"Empty words from a coward’s mouth! To battle!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle02_01":"We’ll need to subdue these Romulans before they warn Sela of our approach!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_01":"You again? I’m surprised you were able to sneak up on our position.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_02":"How positively Romulan of you!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_03":"You won’t get away this! Hand over Captain Kirk!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_04":"Should I be threatened by a doctor?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_05":"Your self-righteousness bores me. Let’s get this over with.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_post_01":"Wait! Hold your fire!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_post_02":"Your mother would have fought until the end!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_post_03":"My mother was a fool who died running away.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_post_04":"You should know that while we were busy skirmishing, Captain Kirk was ushered off-world. He’s safely aboard a Warbird as we speak.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_post_05":"To where? What are you devils planning?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_post_06":"He's of no value to us. To others, however, he’s a tantalizing prize…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_post_07":"You WILL tell us Captain Kirk’s location.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_post_08":"Very well. There’s no way you’re going to save him. He’s being held by Romulan High Command as a prisoner of war...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_post_09":"The empire is planning to exchange him for an alliance with the Gorn.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_battle05_post_10":"I would hurry if I were you. The Gorn aren’t known for their hospitality… Hah!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_exploration01_01":"A Romulan encampment, hastily abandoned. We should search it for clues to Kirk’s location.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_exploration01_02":"That device over there looks like a comms unit. I’ll try to hack it’s logs…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_exploration01_reaction01_01":"This datapad belonged to a Romulan Centurion…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_exploration01_reaction01_02":"It appears the Romulans are transporting Captain Kirk southeast, to a Romulan transport site.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_exploration01_reaction02_01":"The Romulans have purged the files, but I’ve been able to restore fragments of the log.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_exploration01_reaction02_02":"Looks like they were in contact with an unidentified vessel.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_exploration01_reaction02_03":"No doubt cloaked conveniently out of sight…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_exploration01_reaction02_04":"I’ve found Sela’s position as well! If we hurry, we might be able to reach Captain Kirk before they leave the planet!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_exploration01_reaction03_01":"They were certainly in a hurry to get out of here. They left valuable supplies behind.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_story01_01":"<i>Sub-commander, what is your status? Respond!</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_story01_02":"Sela! You bring dishonor to the name of Tasha Yar.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_story01_03":"<i>I'm working for the good of my people. I haven’t betrayed them, like you have.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_story01_04":"You fool! You’re trapped in this “Nexus” just like we are!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_story01_05":"<i>“Nexus”? What nonsense is this?</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_story01_06":"She doesn’t know… What if she’s part of this place?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_story01_07":"Enough of this. Where is Captain Kirk?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_story01_08":"<i>If you value your lives, you will forget your captain!</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m2_story01_09":"<i>Farewell. I can’t imagine we’ll meet again.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle01_01":"What is that?!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle01_02":"You wouldn’t have met one yet, but Jim Kirk did. They’re called the Gorn.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle01_03":"Drazz'tak norshgrrz!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle01_04":"It seems the universal translator is having difficulty with the Gorn language...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle01_05":"He is challenging us to battle! Prepare yourselves!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle01_post_01":"Worf, you speak Gorn?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle01_post_02":"Not expressly, but as a Klingon warrior, one has a knack for… reading between the lines.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle03_01":"Commander Tomalak has ordered you eliminated, Federation pests.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle05_post_01":"Do you think this is over?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle05_post_02":"My warbird waits in orbit. I'll return and blast you to atoms!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle05_post_03":"Dramatic fellow. He's right out of one of those Old Earth serials Sulu loves so much…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle05_post_04":"<i>Spock to Artemis away team. We’ve been following the situation from here.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle05_post_05":"<i>With Tomalak’s defeat, we’ve been able to intercept Romulan transmissions indicating where the Gorn are holding Captain Kirk.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_battle05_post_06":"<i>I will send you the coordinates. It is imperative we reach the Captain before it is too late.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_exploration01_01":"I have found a piece of Romulan technology. It seems to be the source of the transmissions.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_exploration01_02":"I might be able to access it and replay more of their communications.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_exploration01_03":"I’m picking up Gorn life-signs over that ridge. They might lead us to Jim.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_exploration01_reaction01_01":"We’re through. It’ll take a few minutes to route the data stream to my PADD.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_exploration01_reaction02_01":"More Gorn just over there. We should try to ambush them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_exploration01_reaction02_02":"An excellent tactical decision. For a doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_exploration01_reaction02_03":"Thank you. I think.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story01_01":"I'm picking up a Romulan transmission originating nearby","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story01_02":"It must be the unit escorting Captain Kirk","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story01_03":"Maybe... let me see if I can intercept the signal.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story01_04":"<i>... proceed to the designated location. We look forward to meeting with your ambassador in person.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story01_05":"<i>Be wary of… pests that may interfere with our meeting. Tomalak out.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story01_06":"That is Tomalak, a Romulan Commander. My <i>Enterprise</i> has had several encounters with him.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story01_07":"He is duplicitous, and will stop at nothing to meet his goal.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story02_01":"<i>Commander Tomalak, the meeting with the Gorn delegates commences as planned.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story02_02":"<i>Are we really forging an alliance with these brutes?</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story02_03":"<i>My dear sub-commander, you shouldn’t be unkind to our hosts.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story02_04":"<i>After all, they will be on the front line when we expand into Federation space.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story02_05":"<i>Brilliant, Commander. What of the Federation spies we’ve detected?</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story02_06":"<i>Dispose of them quietly. They must not interfere with our meeting.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story03_01":"Just ahead… Keep your voices down. There's something happening.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story03_02":"“Something” is right. I see Romulans AND Gorn.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story03_03":"...we’ve made good on our promise to deliver Kirk. Now... Do we have your support?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story03_04":"<The Nest Father appreciates your gift as he approaches the great shedding.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story03_05":"It’s using a translator device. I’m surprised the Gorn have a tool meant for diplomacy.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story03_06":"<The One known as Kirk is on his way to the Nest Father's base. But...>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story03_07":"<Before we speak further… I assume the Federation troops stalking behind those rocks aren't your allies…>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m3_story03_08":"My apologies. We will see to this intrusion.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_battle05_01":"So the Gorn brought you here as well? You’ll hand over your equipment, or we’ll take it from you.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_battle05_02":"We’re hardly prisoners. We’re here for my friend!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_battle05_03":"First one to bring down the Klingon gets his bat'leth!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_battle06_01":"These are the Gorn I gave the slip. Cunning devils. Let’s take them by surprise!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_battle06_02":"What, no makeshift dynamite this time?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_battle06_post_01":"<i>Enterprise to Captain Kirk. I am glad to see you are well, Captain.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_battle06_post_02":"Spock! It’s good to hear your voice. But we’re not leaving yet. The Gorn and Romulans are planning something.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_battle06_post_03":"Captain, we must regroup before they enact their plan. We must be prepared when they make their move.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_exploration01_01":"What on earth happened to them?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_exploration01_02":"It's Jim! Jim happened to them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_exploration01_03":"We should scan the area to see which way he went.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_exploration01_04":"One of the Gorn is still alive. Perhaps he will have knowledge of Captain Kirk.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_exploration01_05":"I’m no herpetologist, Mr. Worf, but maybe there’s something I can do for him.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_exploration01_reaction01_01":"I've found signs that he was here barely an hour ago.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_exploration01_reaction01_02":"We should follow this path!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_exploration01_reaction02_01":"Well, it’s minor miracle. Looks like he’ll pull through.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_exploration01_reaction02_02":"He’s pointing east! That might be the direction the Captain escaped to.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_exploration01_reaction03_01":"Give me a moment. We're running low on supplies.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story01_01":"Captain Kirk must be nearby. But among these rocks... it's like finding a needle in the proverbial haystack.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story01_02":"Can you try tracking his communicator? He might have managed to hide it when he was captured.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story01_03":"It's working! He's close!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_01":"Jim! Is that you, man?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_02":"Bones! I’ve never been happier to see you!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_03":"But what on earth are you doing here? Who are your friends?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_04":"Commander Burnham of the <i>U.S.S. Discovery</i>. It’s a pleasure, Captain.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_05":"And I am Lieutenant Worf of the <i>Enterprise</i>. It's an honor, Captain. I studied your exploits at the Academy. They were most impressive.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_06":"The <i>U.S.S. Discovery</i>? A Klingon... on the <i>Enterprise</i>?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_07":"An <i>Enterprise</i> from the future, Jim. Wherever we ended up has scrambled the timeline.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_08":"That would explain Romulans and the Gorn working together. Follow me, we’ve got work to do!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_09":"Well, he sure looks like the real deal. Worf, what do you say? Tell me that’s Jim over there!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_10":"I’m afraid not, Doctor. It is another one of the Nexus’ creations.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m4_story02_11":"But I believe we should follow him. Let us see how this plays out.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle03_01":"Those are Romulans ahead. They must be part of the delegation.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle03_02":"Let’s end this alliance before it gets started!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle04_01":"Keep pushing! We must be close to the center of the base.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_01":"So it is you!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_02":"<And you... my oldest, finest adversary.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_03":"Why are you doing this? I let you live!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_04":"<Before you, Human-Kirk, I was unbeaten. A champion of my people.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_05":"<Until you bested me. For all my strength and might, I tasted defeat for the first time, and at the hands of a lesser species.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_06":"You think I cheated you. Unfairly robbed you of your prestige","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_07":"<Cheated? No, Human-Kirk. You won with ingenuity and bravery. The only worthy opponent I had ever faced.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_08":"<Now come. Let’s see us see if you can do so again.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_post_01":"<You have defeated me once more>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_post_02":"<You are as I wished. A great final opponent, Human-Kirk.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_post_03":"You... hit just as hard as I remember. If I hadn't had help...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_post_04":"So, wait... you did all this for a fight? Allied yourself with the Romulans just so you two could punch each other?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_post_05":"<Allies? No. They are an untrustworthy people. Their only purpose for us was as fodder in a war against the Federation.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_post_06":"So you never planned on working with them?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_battle07_post_07":"<Human-Kirk, you taught me what all the duels on my homeworld could not: sometimes your wits are the greatest weapon.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_01":"More Gorn guards. This must be where the Nest Father is waiting.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_02":"They will not block our way for long!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_03":"Wait. Take it from me, Gorn don’t go down as easy as you think.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_04":"Bones? Thoughts?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_05":"We could try sneaking around. Or we can try a diplomatic approach, but do you really think these lizards will listen?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_06":"As a xeno-anthropologist, I think I might have an idea…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_reaction01_01":"The direct approach will save us time we need. But be careful!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_reaction02_01":"We, the weaker species, humbly submit ourselves to the authority of the Nest Father. We come to swear fealty to his name, long may he reign.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_reaction02_02":"<You are wise not to think you could best him… or us…in combat. You may proceed.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_reaction02_03":"I’m impressed, Burnham!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_reaction02_04":"I wasn’t sure it would work, but some species are more susceptible to flattery than others.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration01_reaction03_01":"I’ve scanned the area and found another route into the base.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration02_01":"Hold up, I think I hear voices coming from inside there!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration02_02":"You're right. And they sound human! More prisoners, maybe?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration02_03":"The door is locked. We must get inside!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration02_reaction01_01":"I’m reading life signs, but through this shielding I can’t be sure if they’re allies or enemies...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration02_reaction01_02":"They may be Gorn. We should press on. We do not have much time.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration02_reaction02_01":"Thank you! We were captured while on a mission to find dilithium deposits…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration02_reaction02_02":"We accidentally wandered too close to Gorn space, and they didn’t take kindly to the intrusion.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_exploration02_reaction02_03":"Kirk to <i>Enterprise</i>. Spock, we’ve freed captured Starfleet officers. Two to beam up.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_01":"So... Captain. Any idea why does this Gorn “Father of Nests” want you so badly?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_02":"I wasn't sure at first, until they referred to me as his “greatest adversary”...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_03":"You mean it's the same one you fought after the Cestus III attack?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_04":"It’s the only Gorn I’ve ever met. As Spock would say, it’s…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_05":"Yeah, yeah.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_06":"Cestus III? The frontier colony?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_07":"That’s the one. The Gorn attacked it, but before we could defeat them the Gorn Captain and I were taken by a powerful race called the Metrons.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_08":"They stuck the two of us on a desolate world and had us fight it out for their amusement. I won, barely. Spared the Gorn’s life.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_09":"And now he thanks you for your mercy by plotting with the Romulans!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_10":"Well, we didn’t part on the best of terms…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_11":"Captain, it’s possible that all of these enemies may just be creations of this dimension we’re trapped in.... this “Nexus”.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story01_12":"Well, they certainly hit hard enough to be real. And I certainly feel real. Can we really take the chance they’re not?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story03_01":"<i>I am most disappointed, Nest Father. I thought our people had found common ground.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story03_02":"You know, Tomalak, the last time I encountered your people, they didn’t appear so eager to wage war.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story03_03":"<i>The empire has changed a great deal since your time, Captain Kirk.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story03_04":"<i>You were a legend to my people. But often legends are full of lies.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story03_05":"<i>I will give you one more chance, Nest Father. Ally yourselves with me, or be destroyed.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story03_06":"<Your empty threats betray your cowardice. You are unworthy of an alliance.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story03_07":"<i>Please, take your time to think it over. After all, once you’ve been eliminated, perhaps your people will choose a more... amenable leader.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story03_08":"<i>You have one Romulan hour. I look forward to your surrender.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m5_story03_09":"That doesn’t give us much time. We’ve got to prepare for the Romulan assault!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle01_01":"Romulans are beaming down. We’ll have to deal with them first!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle03_01":"Kill them all! A bar of latinum to the first trooper to bring one of them down.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle03_02":"A single bar? I'm not sure whether to be flattered or offended...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle04_01":"Over there! The Commander wants none of them left alive!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_01":"Must I do everything myself? If my troops can't kill the lot of you, I’ll gladly finish the job!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_01":"Nest Father! I’m glad to see you’ve pulled through. I hope this time we can depart on more friendly terms.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_02":"<Yes. Leave with my blessing. I can depart for the Great Shedding with pride.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_03":"Great Shedding? That sounds... ominous.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_04":"<I am dying, Human-Kirk. Rotting away from a disease that blackens the scale and renders our blood toxic.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_05":"<Forgive me for capturing you but... I wished to die like a warrior. Not like a hatchling, cowering by its egg.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_06":"Black scale... That sounds like Patheorix. A saurid disease. The Federation cured that twenty years ago!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_07":"With any luck, I can resequence the gene therapy involved so it might work for your species!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_08":"<There is... a cure? You and your kind are wonders, Human-Kirk. You would make much better allies than the Romulans, I think.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_09":"<Here. Take this as a token of my gratitude. And perhaps a new era between our people.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_10":"Wait. Is that a...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_11":"<My soldiers found it recently. Some artifact they claimed lay deep in the sand, so hot that it turned everything around it to glass. Odd, isn't it?>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_12":"Odd doesn’t begin to describe. This artifact is similar to the one that powered Talos. This cannot be a coincidence.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_battle06_post_13":"One device might be an outlier, but two? There’s something at work here. We need to beam back to the <i>Artemis</i> and study them properly!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration01_01":"I hear something down that corridor. Sounds like more headed this way!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration01_02":"Here is where we should make our stand! There is enough debris that we could construct a barricade.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration01_03":"Or we can force these bulkhead doors closed to buy some time!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Hurry! There’s almost on us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration01_reaction02_01":"Hrgghhhhh...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration01_reaction02_02":"Well done, Worf. Remind me not arm-wrestle you later.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration01_reaction03_01":"Call me crazy, but there must be a better place for a last stand.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration01_reaction03_02":"You're right, Doctor. We should retreat.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration02_01":"Wait, this one's still breathing!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration02_02":"<Ah, Human-ally-of-Kirk. It looks like my fighting days are over.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration02_03":"Can you help him, Doctor McCoy?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration02_04":"I’m learning Gorn anatomy on the fly, but I’ll give it a shot…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration02_reaction01_01":"<Leave me for now. Tomalak is surely coming to personally oversee the attack. Go, while you still can.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration02_reaction02_01":"Can you save him, Doctor?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration02_reaction02_02":"He’ll have quite a migraine in that massive skull, but he should be able to fight.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration02_reaction03_01":"<Wait, before you go. Tomalak is surely coming down to personally oversee the attack. Take these supplies and finish him.>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration03_01":"That device over there looks like another piece of Romulan technology.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration03_02":"They must have beamed it in when the attack began.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration03_03":"It’s transmitting our location to the warbird in orbit. We need to disable it!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration03_reaction01_01":"We just need to figure out a way to turn this off. Is there a button or...?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration03_reaction01_02":"Just shoot the thing and let's keep moving!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration03_reaction01_03":"That… works.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration03_reaction02_01":"Perhaps we might be able to use this to our advantage. If we can adjust the transmission code…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_exploration03_reaction02_02":"We can feed them false data! Brilliant, Worf!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story01_01":"<i>Your leader failed to honor the terms of our agreement. We do not tolerate betrayal!</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story01_02":"The <i>Artemis</i> is detecting weapons powering up on the Romulan Warbird in orbit!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story01_03":"Kirk to <i>Enterprise</i>. Spock, why don’t we give our new friends on the… <i>Artemis</i>, is it?... a helping hand.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story01_04":"<i>Aye, Captain. Moving the <i>Enterprise</i> to intercept the Romulan vessel.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story01_05":"We’ll stay behind and help get the Gorn to safety.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story01_06":"<i>I suggest the <i>Artemis’</i> away team head to the nearest transporter pad while we engage the Romulans.</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story01_07":"<i>Do not think your escape will not be so easy!</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story02_01":"<i>Spock to Captain Kirk. Sir, we have neutralized the Romulan warbird. Are you and Dr. McCoy ready to beam back aboard the <i>Enterprise</i>?</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story02_02":"And that looks like our cue to beam out as well. What do you say, Bones, are you ready to head for home...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story02_03":"I’m sorry, Jim. My place is with Burnham and Worf. You see… You aren’t even real, my friend.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story02_04":"What do you mean I’m not rea--","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story02_05":"One moment... I’m getting an energy reading. And it’s growing.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story02_06":"From the artifact?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e2_m6_story02_07":"No - this is coming from.. Somewhere else. The signature appears to resemble some sort of wormhole.... And it’s forming right on top of us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_battle01_01":"Starfleet scum! You thought you could kidnap the great Gul Dukat?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_battle01_02":"We didn’t kidnap anyone. Lower your weapons!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_battle01_03":"It is pointless to reason with Cardassians, Burnham.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_battle01_04":"You’ll pay for this treachery with your lives!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration01_01":"Hu'tegh! This atmosphere burns hotter than the fire caverns of Boreth!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration01_02":"I’ll take your word for it. The ship’s picking up a long-range mayday transmission… Federation by the sound of it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration01_03":"Look over there, towards those hills… There’s some sort of device half-buried in the sand. Could it be coming from that?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration01_04":"No, but scans show massive amounts of energy contained inside that thing; enough to knock a starship out of orbit!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration01_05":"Should we investigate?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration01_reaction01_01":"We should find the mayday signal first. Could be injured survivors.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration01_reaction02_01":"A device that powerful could fall into enemy hands. We must disable it immediately!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration02_01":"Hmmm… There are several sets of footprints here, most likely Cardassian. A large group passing right through the dune.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration02_02":"They’re heading straight for the mayday signal.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration02_03":"There’s a smaller set of footprints heading off to the side, around the dune. It might be a shortcut!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration02_reaction01_01":"We should press on. If the Cardassians reach the signal source before we do, any survivors will suffer a gruesome fate.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_exploration02_reaction02_01":"If that side trail means we can beat the Cardassians to the beacon, it’s a risk worth taking.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_story01_01":"Ahead of us! A crashed Starfleet shuttle!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_story01_02":"That’s the source of the mayday.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m1_story01_03":"Hurry, let’s look for survivors!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle02_01":"Federation fools! Cease your pursuit of Gul Dukat! You have no authority here!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle02_02":"Ah! <i>*growls*</i>Now the Cardassian presence here makes sense. They're attempting to rescue their Commander!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_01":"Will your kind never learn?! I will not be caged!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_02":"Stand down, Dukat! We have you outnumbered.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_03":"You think I face you alone? The gods are on my side.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_04":"Odo was a fool to think this is some mere trinket.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_05":"This is a BLACK DURANJA: a vessel fashioned to contain the power of the PAH WRAITHS!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_06":"AGGHHHHHHHHH!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_post_01":"Are you all alright?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_post_02":"Worst headache I’ve ever had… but I’m alive.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_post_03":"I felt like I was fighting against something truly evil.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_post_04":"On Vulcan we were taught that evil, as most races define the word, is merely a failure of reason.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_post_05":"But that… thing… might be the exception to the rule.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_post_06":"Scans aren't picking up any traces of that entity on Dukat.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_post_07":"It probably abandoned its host in search of another. I doubt it’ll find one on this desolate planet.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_post_08":"Let us hope you are correct.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_battle08_post_09":"McCoy to <i>Artemis</i>. Three to beam up… with one Cardassian in tow.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_01":"I don’t recognize this shuttle type…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_02":"It is a runabout from Deep Space Nine, Doctor, after your time.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_03":"Nobody’s here, but the debris fields stretches over the dunes.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Follow the debris. We might find survivors.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction01_02":"According to this data recorder, the runabout was shot down when approaching the planet.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction01_03":"That could have been the work of the strange device we found.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction02_01":"The runabout is abandoned, but it seems to have been used as a prisoner transport.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction02_02":"The crash must have disabled the holding cell’s force field.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction02_03":"I found footprints leading away from the shuttle… Let's follow them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction03_01":"The data from the ship’s computer says the pilot was somebody named… ‘Odo’?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction03_02":"Odo is an old colleague of mine. A Changeling in charge of security on Deep Space Nine.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction03_03":"The manifest says he was transporting a prisoner named Gul Dukat to Bajor to stand trial.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction03_04":"Gul Dukat! One of the worst wretches the Federation has ever dealt with.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration01_reaction03_05":"We must recapture him immediately!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration02_01":"Looks like some kind of a starship graveyard!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration02_02":"Judging by the damage, they were all downed by the same weapon that struck the shuttle.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration02_03":"The footprints lead directly through it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration02_04":"Looks like a dust storm’s closing in. Better hurry, or we’ll be breathing sand!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration02_reaction01_01":"If these footprints are indeed Dukat’s, he seems to have gone deep into the desert.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration02_reaction01_02":"We should follow before the storm erases the tracks.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration02_reaction02_01":"Over there! That looks like a piece of a tracking cuff. Speaking from experience…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration02_reaction02_02":"He must have tried to knock it off. We can use this piece to track him.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_01":"There’s some form of encampment by those rocks.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_02":"Looks like a makeshift shelter, maybe Dukat’s?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_03":"This blasted sand covered his tracks!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_04":"Let’s investigate. There may still be something there we can use to find him.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_reaction01_01":"I can’t see anything in this storm!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_reaction01_02":"If we stop now, Dukat’s home free!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_reaction02_01":"Over here! It’s a datapad. Looks like Dukat plans to rendezvous with a Cardassian vessel and escape.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_reaction02_02":"We’re in luck. Had it not been for the storm, he would have escaped already.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_reaction02_03":"For a Klingon, you sure know how to look on the bright side.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_reaction02_04":"If we press on, we can catch Dukat before he escapes.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_reaction03_01":"Dukat left equipment behind in his shelter.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m2_exploration03_reaction03_02":"Looks like medical supplies. I can put these to good use.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_battle01_01":"Just when I was glad to be rid of the Cardassians…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_battle01_02":"Walk away! This is our territory now. Your kind is not welcome here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_battle01_03":"Bah! On whose orders do you claim this planet?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_battle01_04":"Our own! Any treasure buried in these sands is ours!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_battle01_05":"Mercenaries! The lowest form of honor-less dogs.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_battle01_06":"Hah! I'd be insulted if this wasn’t coming from a Klingon lackey of the Federation!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_battle06_01":"Thank you for leading us inside, Federation fools!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_battle06_02":"You congratulate yourselves too soon!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration01_01":"So, this friend of yours - Odo - any idea where he would have gone?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration01_02":"He would have first sought shelter from the storms.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration01_03":"Well, I can't match Vulcans when it comes to logic, but…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration01_04":"…the shuttle crashed in a valley with only two obvious exits. We know Dukat went one way. My best guess is Odo went the other.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Tread carefully. There might be more mercenaries nearby.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration01_reaction02_01":"Let’s get as high as we can. We’ll have a better chance of spotting him.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration01_reaction02_02":"Your tactical acumen is impressive, Doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration01_reaction02_03":"Not tactics, Worf. Just plain common sense!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration02_01":"Over there! The mercenaries’ camp!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration02_02":"The area must be teeming with them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration02_reaction01_01":"We should avoid them. We’re here for a rescue, not a war.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration02_reaction01_02":"You are right. We should avoid unnecessary combat.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration02_reaction01_03":"Look there! Is that a combadge in the sand?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration02_reaction01_04":"Yes! This belongs to Odo. The Bajoran design is distinctive. We're on the right track.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration02_reaction02_01":"If left alone they might ambush us at any point. Best to deal with them now!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration02_reaction02_02":"They might know where Odo is!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_01":"I’d say that’s a door built to keep people out. Or to keep something in.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_02":"Yes, and its architecture and patterns are similar to those other devices we’ve come across.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_03":"It seems to be shut tight. I don’t see a way Odo could have gotten inside.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_04":"Odo’s form is somewhat... fluid. He’s able to change it in order to get through tight spaces.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_05":"Sounds like Starfleet’s now recruiting all kinds of interesting folks.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_06":"Well, if nobody’s got the key, how do we open this thing?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_reaction01_01":"Perhaps we can use our tricorders to locate the locking mechanism and disrupt it?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_reaction02_01":"It might be possible to destroy the rock around the door with our phasers, so that we might pass through.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_reaction03_01":"Interesting! Scans show there's an immense structure hidden behind it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_reaction03_02":"Faint traces of energy, most likely to power the locking mechanism.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_exploration03_reaction03_03":"I think I can override the lock…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_story01_01":"Stop! It's another one of the alien devices.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_story01_02":"This one is more active than the other. Scans reveal heavier shielding, and energy pulsing out across nearby rocks.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_story01_03":"We should steer clear of it. Finding Odo is our priority.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m3_story01_04":"Let’s look for a path around it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_01":"Resist...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_02":"...futile...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_03":"Ahead of us – a Borg drone!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_04":"A… Borg? Like a cyborg?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_05":"No. The Borg are a predatory race of organic life forms assimilated into a collective hivemind. They are the greatest threat the Federation has ever faced!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_06":"Exizztenz...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_07":"...iz -  iz -  izzz over…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_08":"Well, when you put it that way…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_post_01":"Odd. This Borg drone seemed far less functional than others I've encountered.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_post_02":"Who knows how long it’s been trapped in here?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_post_03":"Yes, it has fallen into disrepair. Although these walls do resemble the interior of the species’ ships.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_post_04":"The complex is silent. Only a few of the mechanisms here seem to be working properly, if powered at all.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle01_post_05":"Let’s find Odo before he’s – what did you call it? “Assimilated”?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle02_01":"Up ahead! Are those… Starfleet crew?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle02_02":"What are the odds that Starfleet officers are just hanging around an abandoned alien facility?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle02_03":"Look at their eyes! I’ve not known eyes that glow like that.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle02_04":"They’ve spotted us. And they don’t look friendly!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle02_post_01":"They dissolve when defeated!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle02_post_02":"Changelings like Odo?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle02_post_03":"Similar, but no. Perhaps they are part of a Borg experiment…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle06_01":"Over there! That door must be important. It's heavily guarded.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle06_02":"We are...the B-B-Borg.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle06_03":"You will be...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle06_04":"....be... assimilated.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle06_05":"RESISTANCE IS…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_battle06_06":"FUTILE!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration01_01":"Careful! There's some sort of flooding here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration01_02":"Scans show high amounts of dimethyl cadmium, hexavalent chromium and a mix of other toxic ingredients.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration01_03":"Not a cocktail you want to drink.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration01_04":"Time is short. We can simply wade across.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration01_05":"I can give you a hypospray to prepare you, but don’t blame me for the hangover.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Ugh... I feel nauseous…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration01_reaction01_02":"It will pass…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration01_reaction01_03":"I’ve had moonshine that hit harder.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration01_reaction02_01":"Let’s look for another way around.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration01_reaction02_02":"Perhaps in this case, as the human Shakespeare once said, \"discretion is the better part of valor\".","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_01":"Borg! Hundreds of them!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_02":"They seem... dormant?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_03":"It could be that they all shut down when the lights went out in here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_04":"Let's investigate.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_reaction01_01":"Bear with me... The circuitry here is very corroded.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_reaction01_02":"The last entry was almost 200 years ago. Strange to think this was around even before my time.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_reaction01_03":"The data is badly corrupted. There's a reference to some sort of atmospheric disaster.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_reaction01_04":"Perhaps meteorites have damaged this facility. That would explain the craters on the surface.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_reaction01_05":"The facility seems to have come back online in response to an intruder.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_reaction01_06":"That could be Odo. He could be in here somewhere.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_reaction02_01":"Quiet now. No sense waking the locals…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_reaction03_01":"Odo!! Can you hear us?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration02_reaction03_02":"Is it me or do the Borg seem more... animated?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration03_01":"It’s another one of those devices we saw outside.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration03_02":"Do you hear that humming? I think it’s powering up!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration03_03":"If it is indeed a Borg creation, we must try to shut it down.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration03_04":"Easier said than done. It’s heavily shielded.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration03_05":"Looks like the locals are waking up!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration03_reaction01_01":"Ready phasers!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration03_reaction02_01":"Just give me a moment, I think I can override it…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m4_exploration03_reaction02_02":"They’re powering up!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle01_01":"More of those strange-eyed doppelgangers! Ready your weapons!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle01_post_01":"They are definitely not Borg. Almost closer to Changelings…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle01_post_02":"Let’s hope they didn’t do something to Odo!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle04_01":"More of the doppelgangers!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle04_post_01":"Odo, any idea what these things are?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle04_post_02":"They’re nothing like my people. They seem soulless, like the Borg.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle04_post_03":"I've seen them coming and going since I was captured. All from deeper inside the Complex.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle05_01":"Primary Objective: Protect pool from intruders.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle05_02":"Secondary protocol: Assimilation.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle05_03":"What “pool” are they talking about?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle07_01":"Something’s emerging from the pool!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle07_02":"It looks like… Odo?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle07_03":"But I never came into contact with the fluid.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle07_04":"Well, it doesn’t look like it wants a friendly chat.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle07_05":"Defend yourselves!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle07_post_01":"Sorry, my friend, but one of me is all this universe can handle.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle07_post_02":"And I’ve got the Nexus device.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_battle07_post_03":"I think one of the Borg called it a ”Reactor”…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration01_01":"We're lost, aren't we?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration01_02":"No. We're just... navigating cautiously.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration01_reaction01_01":"All of these passages look the same to me. Left turn maybe? It seems quieter. Darker and creepier. But quieter.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration01_reaction02_01":"Hmmm... The lights seem to be working along the corridor on the right.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration01_reaction02_02":"More power will likely mean more Borg. Stay alert!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_01":"Worf! Over here!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_02":"Odo!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_03":"You’re that last face I expected to see. But a welcome one!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_04":"The Borg have kept in this shielded room for days.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_05":"Do you have any idea what they're up to?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_06":"They attempted to assimilate me, fortunately with no success.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_07":"Now the Borg seem interested in my ability to shapeshift. I’ve been prodded and poked more times than I care to count.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_08":"We can try to overload the shields with short phaser bursts.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_09":"That might draw unwelcome attention. I can try to hack it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_reaction01_01":"There! That did it!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_reaction01_02":"Nice work. Now can we get out of here? I prefer a sandstorm to these Borg.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_reaction02_01":"Hurry, Odo!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_reaction02_02":"I’m afraid I’m not in optimal shape.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_reaction02_03":"They tried to prevent me from escaping by injecting me with nanobots that stop me from shifting.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration02_reaction02_04":"I can overcome them but… it will take time. Go ahead, I’m right behind you","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_01":"That must be the pool the drone mentioned!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_02":"It’s Mimetic fluid… It’s able to sample DNA and produce clones of the original life-form.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_03":"This could allow the Borg to multiply indefinitely, faster than by assimilating other species!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_04":"None of the doppelgangers we’ve encountered seem to be Borg, though. That means they have yet to successfully utilize the pool.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_05":"So where did they get the DNA from?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_06":"Perhaps captives of the Borg? The pool might have sampled their DNA and is now spontaneously producing copies of them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_07":"I have another suggestion. Look there, in the shadows above the pool.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_08":"Good eyes, Worf! It’s another of those Nexus Devices! It appears to be discharging energy into the pool.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_09":"We have to shut this down before the Borg are able to unlock the fluid’s full potential!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_reaction01_01":"I concur. Phasers on full!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_reaction02_01":"If this fluid is what you say it is, we should at least retrieve a sample.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_reaction03_01":"If this fluid can replicate life, that suggests it could be organic. Perhaps even sentient…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_reaction03_02":"Sentient? It is a pool of liquid.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_reaction03_03":"Perhaps a Borg scout stumbled across it and this facility was constructed to exploit it?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m5_exploration03_reaction03_04":"Then it’s a prisoner of the Borg, not simply a threat to destroy.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_battle01_01":"Resistance is futile!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_battle01_02":"There's more Borg ahead!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_battle01_03":"You will be assimilated.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_battle01_04":"More drones are waking up!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_battle01_05":"Not just the Borg. The entire complex is coming online!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_battle07_post_01":"Nicely done! The complex is shutting down!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_battle07_post_02":"Indeed! And its shields have lost power. Communication with the <i>Artemis</i> is fully restored.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_battle07_post_03":"The walls around us… they’re fading… as if the very fabric of reality is collapsing around us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_battle07_post_04":"These devices we’ve been finding – the “Reactors” – they appear to be the ones causing this collapse!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_battle07_post_05":"Let’s not wait around then. Bones to <i>Artemis</i>. Three to beam up!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration01_01":"If they have the power to blast starships out of the sky, the <i>Artemis</i> is a sitting duck right now!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration01_02":"We must shut off the power once and for all!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration01_03":"Those nodes we encountered earlier must regulate the complex’s power grid.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration01_04":"If that's the case, we may be able to disrupt several of them, alter the flow and divert power away from the main system.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Looks like we're going to have to fight our way through!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration01_reaction02_01":"That's... a lot of Borg. A direct attack on a group this size would be suicide.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration01_reaction02_02":"I agree with the new guy. Let’s find another way out.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration02_01":"There! A power node.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration02_02":"Scans indicate this is the only node still active and powering the complex.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration02_03":"If we can destroy it, it will cut off the power across the facility, lowering and shields and preventing the drones from recharging.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration02_04":"The less we talk, the sooner this nightmare is over!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration02_reaction01_01":"I believe I can configure the barrier around the node to extend and shield us from the Borg.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration02_reaction02_01":"That node there must be the Borg’s local communication array.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration02_reaction02_02":"Destroy it and we should be able to break each drone’s link to the Collective, at least temporarily.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration02_reaction03_01":"If I can just hit that pipe, I might be able to use the Borg's corrosives against them...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration02_reaction03_02":"There, that should slow them down!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e3_m6_exploration02_reaction04_01":"If they’re still partly organic, let’s see what havoc a potent hypospray causes on their system…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle01_01":"Through those trees... is that... it is! Looks like one of our guys!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle01_02":"Gragghhhhh!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle01_03":"Something's terribly wrong with them. Look at the way they move!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle01_post_01":"They’ve attacked with such unbridled ferocity.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle01_post_02":"I’ve never seen Federation officers so frenetic... What do your scans indicate, McCoy?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle01_post_03":"Elevated white blood cells and stress hormones. Whatever this is, it’s not entirely psychological.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle03_01":"Lieutenant Commander La Forge?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle03_02":"You know this man?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle03_03":"La Forge is the most talented engineer I have ever served with.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle03_04":"Raggghhhhhh!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle03_05":"Well, for god's sake, man... Tell him to stop attacking us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle03_post_01":"I don’t have much time. My head... feels heavy. We detected a signal from the Neutral zone.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle03_post_02":"It was encrypted with... Romulan command codes. I couldn’t decode the message, but I did determine where it was sent.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle03_post_03":"The Romulans have a contact somewhere in this outpost. I hope someone finds this. End recording.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle03_post_04":"He’s subdued for now. No doubt affected by the same illness?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle03_post_05":"He's showing the same symptoms as the others. about the recording suggests he discovered some Romulan connection to all this.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle06_01":"Romulans?! What are they doing here?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle06_02":"Graggghhhh!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle06_03":"This illness doesn’t discriminate between species... That doesn’t bode well.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle10_01":"Ahead of us! This must be the cache of supplies Dr. Crusher mentioned...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle10_02":"Gragghhhhh!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle10_03":"Prepare yourselves. The Captain Sisko of my time is not a man to be trifled with. Infected or not...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle10_post_01":"Commander Burnham to Doctor Crusher. We’ve obtained the Theragen from the supply cache.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_battle10_post_02":"Excellent work! Once you get these to my lab, I should be able to synthesize a cure!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration01_01":"Look ahead, more Starfleet officers. Are they unconscious?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration01_02":"We should move on. They may still be dangerous.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration01_03":"Real or not, we ought to treat the poor devils, not leave them to die. I swore the Hippocratic oath!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration01_reaction01_01":"I’ve treated the man with a dose of leporazine - ought to wake him up. He’ll have a hell of a headache, but he should be alright.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration01_reaction01_02":"What happened here?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration01_reaction01_03":"Under fire... There’s an officer trapped, down the path. Need to... Rest...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration01_reaction02_01":"We have to leave them behind, McCoy. Every minute we wait, we’re risking the lives of the officers still out there.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration02_01":"My scans show that device is the source of the comm interference. I don’t recognize the design...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration02_02":"It is Romulan. There are signs of a battle here... we should press on. Romulans do not fight honorably, they may be cloaked nearby.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration02_03":"Hold on... If I can decipher the access logs, I might be able to find out where our Romulan “friends” are hiding.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration02_reaction01_01":"I’ve got it. It’s advanced, but I found a backdoor in their programming and…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration02_reaction01_02":"There’s a small group of Romulans nearby, just down this path!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration02_reaction01_03":"Well done, Burnham.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration02_reaction01_04":"...Well done.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration02_reaction04_01":"I was able to stabilize his vitals. He’s in urgent need of care.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration02_reaction04_02":"Cough... I’ll be fine. Take this hypospray. It should help in case you meet any more of... them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_exploration02_reaction04_03":"Thank you, Doctor. We will send help as soon as we are able.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story01_01":"Dr. Crusher to -zZzt- away team. Are you receiving -Zzzt- transmission?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story01_02":"Doctor, is that you? Our communications seem compromised.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story01_03":"Worf? I don't -BzzT- came from but I need your help!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story01_04":"This outpost -Bzzt- Quarantined. There’s -zZzt- without more supplies.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story01_05":"There’s a Theragen -zZzt- medical supply cache. If you can bring it to me -Bzzt- save lives.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story01_06":"Our primary objective should be getting the supplies she mentioned.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story01_07":"Maybe along the way we can figure out what’s interfering with our communications...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story02_01":"Sub-commander, I am awaiting your report on the infection.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story02_02":"Commander, our forces have become compromised by this... disease. There are only a handful of men remaining.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story02_03":"It is of no consequence. Were you able to secure a sample?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story02_04":"...Yes, commander.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m1_story02_05":"Good. Return once you dispose of any evidence of our involvement.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_battle10_01":"Here they come!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_battle10_post_01":"I think we're safe. Now we can get to work developing an antidote!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_battle10_post_02":"You have something in mind?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_battle10_post_03":"Hard to say... As you said, this infection has moved so quickly I'm worried it's not natural.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_battle10_post_04":"I would know more if we had been able to render them unconscious.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_battle10_post_05":"We’re worried this might be biological warfare. Any information you can give us would be a great help, Doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_battle10_post_06":"Let me get to work and I’ll… I’ll…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_battle10_post_07":"I’m sorry. Give me some time, I’m just feeling a bit faint.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration01_01":"Hmmm... This might be a problem. I can't see an obvious way forward.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration01_02":"Our phasers should be able to destroy the obstruction.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration01_03":"And let the whole damn base know where we are? Are you mad?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration01_04":"Burnham, do you think you can unlock that door?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration01_reaction01_01":"The path is clear. We should hurry on to meet the doctor. I am... concerned.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration01_reaction01_02":"And you nearly took us out along with the damned rubble!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration01_reaction02_01":"I overrode the security protocols, We should be able to get through...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration01_reaction02_02":"It looks like it was set up to lock people out, not in.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration02_01":"The infected are just outside... We don’t have much time. I don’t think those doors will hold for long.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration02_02":"A Klingon never runs from battle. Open the door! We shall face them in combat.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration02_03":"I have a canister of neurazine gas in my lab. Can any of you create a system to disperse it outside?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration02_reaction01_01":"Excellent work! The aerosolized neurazine seems to have put them to sleep. I’ll keep them sedated until we can develop a cure.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration02_reaction03_01":"This hypospray contains a powerful cordrazine stimulant. With the correct dose, it should help prepare us for battle.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_exploration02_reaction03_02":"Cordrazine! Careful, Doctor. That’s powerful stuff. I have... some experience in the matter.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story01_01":"Away team to Dr. Crusher. The medical supplies are secured.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story01_02":"Excellent. I’ll need you to bring them to me in the local clinic.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story01_03":"This disease is spreading too quickly, and we're being overwhelmed.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story02_01":"Scotty!? Damn it, man... What are you doing skulking around in this closet?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story02_02":"Och, I was overwhelmed when trying to rustle up some supplies for the local doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story02_03":"Luckily, the lock was sturdy but it’s a good thing you found me!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story02_04":"You'd better come with us.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story02_05":"Aye, that I will.  This place has turned into a madhouse.  Besides, never hurts to have a proper engineer on yeh side, eh?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story03_01":"It is good to see you, Doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story03_02":"It’s good to see you too, Worf. I see you’ve brought friends.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story03_03":"Doctor McCoy! This... It’s an honor! I studied your treatise on Gorn retroviruses at the academy.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story03_04":"Well now I feel old. Flattered, but old!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story03_05":"What's the situation?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story03_06":"We're dealing with a pathogen that seems to have a near 100% rate of infection.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story03_07":"100%?!  That's impossible... I assume you tried standard antibiotics? What about retrovirals?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story03_08":"Yes. It doesn't seem to respond to...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story03_09":"This is fascinating, Doctor, but you two might want to hurry this up...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story04_01":"I’ve been experimenting with the Theragen compound you brought back.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story04_02":"Scanning the infected, I’m not yet sure how to cure them. The infecting agent... it seems synthetic.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story04_03":"Doctor, any clues as to the source?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story04_04":"I can’t be certain, but there are certain biomarkers in their blood stream in common with Klingon ribosomes.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story04_05":"I’ll continue my research and try to...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m2_story04_06":"...I’m sorry, I’m just feeling a bit faint.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle01_01":"Ugh... I'm having problems focusing on this equipment... I...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle01_02":"... Doctor? Are you all right?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle01_03":"R'ythlettg... Ugh... I have a way of slowing the disease, but I need more Theragen... to be sure.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle01_04":"Um... I think you need to step away from her. Right. Now.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle01_05":"Ragghhhhhh!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle01_post_01":"I’ve sedated her. I’m not sure how long it’ll last.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle11_01":"They're breaking in!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle11_02":"Urggahhhhh!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle11_03":"Was... Was that a language?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle11_04":"This isn’t the time for a linguistics class. It’s the time to act!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle11_post_01":"Let's get back to Dr. Crusher.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_battle11_post_02":"With the Theragen we’ve found, I ought to be able to synthesize a cure.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration01_01":"Tell me you can cure her, Dr. McCoy.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration01_02":"Possibly. She was a genius and had been working on a cure for a while.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration01_03":"There might be something in her notes we can use but... I'm not sure how far she managed to get.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration01_04":"If we could just find more Theragen, there could be a chance...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration01_05":"Let's have a look around.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration01_06":"If all else fails, we may be able to find more medical supplies in a nearby compound.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Burnham’s right, we should continue on to the medical cache.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration01_reaction01_02":"Doctor Crusher, we WILL return for you.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration01_reaction02_01":"I’ve managed to hold off the disease for now, but it’s only a matter of time. She ought to be able to answer a few questions.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration02_01":"This must be the place. Do either of you see anything that looks like Theragen?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration02_02":"These crates will take hours to search! The infected could be upon us at any moment.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration02_03":"I may be able to program our tricorders to scan for the Theragen, if we can enter its molecular resonance frequency.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration02_04":"That’s genius! You’d give old Spock a run for his money.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration02_05":"Thank you, Doctor. It... runs in the family.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration02_reaction02_01":"I’ve located the Theragen, it’s in a crate on the far wall.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration02_reaction02_02":"Excellent work! Let’s get back to Doctor Crusher. There’s still a chance to save her, and the rest of the colony.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration02_reaction02_03":"Hold on, Doctor. I’m detecting several lifeforms just behind those doors.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_exploration02_reaction02_04":"We have been here too long. At least we will have the element of surprise!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story01_01":"Doctor Crusher, any way we can complete synthesizing the cure?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story01_02":"You’ll need more... Theragen... There’s a path through the forest... You should be able to avoid some of the infected.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story01_03":"That’s enough, Beverly. You need your rest.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story02_01":"I’ve been through all of the Doctor’s notes. They’re incredible. Her scans of the nucleotides of-","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story02_02":"Doctor! Can you save her?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story02_03":"I’ve already administered a potential cure, but Worf... There’s no guarantee she’ll pull through.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story02_04":"Her breathing is easing. Whatever you did, it’s working.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story02_05":"Hmm... She’s a fighter, but so is this damn illness.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story02_06":"Now that's odd. Her research noted that the pathogen seemed to resemble betatephlin.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story02_07":"And that's unusual because...?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m3_story02_08":"Betatephlin is a drug. As far as I remember, it's only produced on a single planet... Lupix IV.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle01_01":"Burnham to <i>Artemis.</i> We’ve made it to the planet’s surface and we’re under attack by Klingons!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle01_02":"Zrsah! Zrshharrg'tk!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle01_03":"Well, if we were looking for more of these infected we’re certainly on the right track!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle01_post_01":"We must press on. Finding a cure for the infection is of the utmost importance, even if it means we must battle more of my people.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle01_post_02":"You’re worried about Doctor Crusher, aren’t you Worf?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle01_post_03":"It is not a matter of worry. It is… Practical.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle11_01":"Ahead of us! He is General Martok, a formidable warrior...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle11_02":"I don't know who you are, but you're not getting past me.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle11_post_01":"Damn you... You've bested me.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle11_post_02":"What happened here?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle11_post_03":"A human traitor came to us... One with plans for a new weapon. Biological. Very effective.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle11_post_04":"You crab-headed troll! Biological warfare is outlawed by every race in the quadrant!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle11_post_05":"I... knew that, Doctor.  But there were those in High Command who feared your Federation. And look where that got us.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle11_post_06":"The traitor released the weapon on my troops and escaped with the aid of a group of Romulans leaving our base in ruins!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle11_post_07":"Help us put a stop to this before more people die!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle11_post_08":"Work with the Federation? I still have my pride. I’ll let you go... That’s all I can do for now.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle12_01":"Stop!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle12_02":"Look out!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle12_03":"Stop them before they destroy the equipment!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle12_post_01":"I believe the scientist escaped in the confusion. Should we follow and attempt to apprehend her?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle12_post_02":"We don't need her. Look! Her notes!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle12_post_03":"Let me see those. Well... this would explain the plague. What they were working on wasn't a virus, it’s a delivery system for alien parasites.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle14_01":"Stay away from those plants! The scientist has ordered them protected!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle14_02":"Heck... Thanks for that tip.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle14_post_01":"Over here. This must be the plant the guards were talking about. A cure perhaps?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle14_post_02":"A scan reveals it's similar to betatephlin. It should be enough to overcome this disease!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle14_post_03":"Odd, seems to be genetically manipulated to... Oh. To deal with parasites.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_battle14_post_04":"We’ve got to get back to Dr. Crusher. I’m sure I can develop a cure!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration01_01":"Over there! A pair of guards. Hmph. They look a bit too trigger happy for my liking.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration01_02":"This is the only outpost on the surface. If we want answers...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration01_03":"...We must get in somehow.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration01_reaction03_01":"Worf? They're your people. Maybe you can talk them down?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration01_reaction03_02":"Mev’yap! Come no closer.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration01_reaction03_03":"QaleghneS! I am Worf, son of Mogh. You will allow us to enter this facility.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration01_reaction03_04":"If you dare resist, we will strike you down where you stand!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration02_01":"Who are you? No doubt in league with that... Traitor? We will not be betrayed again! I’m going to call for the guards.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration02_02":"We don’t have much time before they arrive.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration02_03":"Well... Someone say something!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration02_reaction03_01":"We don't want... to fight. We've just come for a cure.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration02_reaction03_02":"Well...  I... you ARE rather handsome. For a human, I mean.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration02_reaction03_03":"...For god's sake. Not this again.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration02_reaction03_04":"...Odd. She seems to be attracted to him yet isn't throwing sharp objects. How... un-Klingon of her.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration02_reaction03_05":"Oh... You get used to it. Trust me!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration03_01":"They're right behind us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration03_02":"We need to hold them off. This looks to be where they're manufacturing the drug they've used on the colony.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration03_03":"With luck we can find something here that we can use towards the cure.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration03_reaction01_01":"With this sample, I’ll be able to synthesize a cure. We’ve got to get back to Doctor Crusher!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_exploration03_reaction01_02":"Burnham to <i>Artemis</i>. We’re ready to beam out!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_story01_01":"I shouldn't give my research to you, but you are... very convincing.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_story01_02":"The “virus” we created is merely a modified form of the drug betatephlin, re-engineered to act as a carrier for a biological lifeform.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_story01_03":"What's driving your colleagues “mad” isn't a disease. It's a parasite.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_story01_04":"Fortunately, we created a cure - a drug that affects the creatures and renders them dormant.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_story01_05":"I'll never forget you. Perhaps... If we'd met in another century... When our kind wasn’t at war.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m4_story01_06":"Burnham to <i>Artemis</i>. We have the cure and we’re ready to beam out!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_battle01_01":"Ahog ot ymg'? Ymg''ll ah'mglw'nafh geb!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_battle01_02":"Well, I don't know what he's saying but I sure as hell don’t like it!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_battle01_post_01":"Did you hear the tone in his voice for a moment? Intelligent. Sharp. It wasn't just random noises. He was speaking.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_battle01_post_02":"Those bugs inside him are maturing and reaching adulthood.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_battle01_post_03":"Unless we release this antidote, it might be too late to save the hosts.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_battle07_01":"More Romulans ahead.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_battle07_02":"The traitor must have made allies of them after betraying the Klingons. Who better than Romulans, the inventors of the cloaking device?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_exploration01_01":"Where do we head to next?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_exploration01_02":"We need to proceed to the filtration unit. The longer we wait, the worse this is going to get.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_exploration01_03":"Eh? There's an injured man lying here. We can't leave him! We've got enough spare antidote to get him back on his feet.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_exploration01_04":"I appreciate your Hippocratic oath, Doctor, but we cannot afford to waste time.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_exploration01_05":"If you really want to put that to good use, Doctor Crusher’s laboratory is nearby. Reviving her could be vital for dealing with this crisis.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_exploration01_06":"Bah. You definitely share Spock’s affection for cold logic.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_exploration02_01":"Over there","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_exploration02_02":"One moment, Doctor. I don't like this. It's quiet. Too quiet.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story01_01":"I've double checked the information. This is simply astounding.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story01_02":"It appears whoever this traitor was, he gave the Klingons a delivery system for a parasitic entity - one that quickly matures into a fully-grown and intelligent form.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story01_03":"I came to that conclusion. Damndest thing I've ever seen. Makes me all... itchy just thinking about it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story01_04":"Luckily, I've been able to reverse engineer the toxin based on the Klingon research.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story01_05":"While it previously acted as a stimulant, it will now act as a sedative.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story01_06":"...slowing their growth and rendering the creatures dormant. Great work, Doctor!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story01_07":"The final step would be to release the compound to the air and force the creatures into a dormant state. We wouldn't want to kill an intelligent species, after all!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story02_01":"Over here! Here's the first of the air filters.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story02_02":"With luck, we'll be able to use it to disperse the cure throughout the compound.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story02_03":"Luck? Hard science, my friend. These connect to every vent in the complex.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story02_04":"Once the hosts begin to breathe this in, the gas should put them and the parasites out like a light.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story02_05":"Allowing us to extract them and save whomever they've infected.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story03_01":"She's still with us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story03_02":"My... head. It feels like something’s squirming inside...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story03_03":"Well, hold still. The cure we worked on should fix you right up.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story03_04":"Ahh. That's better. I can feel the results working already. You're a miracle worker, doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story03_05":"And to think Jim always complains about my bedside manner!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_01":"We've done it! The compound should be flooded with gas shortly.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_02":"Ah, members of the Federation. Come to stop the spread of my friends.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_03":"So, you must be the human the Klingons spoke of?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_04":"A means to an end. Dogs, if you will. Barking whenever their master commands.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_05":"Dogs?! You dare call a Klingon a dog?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_06":"It seems an apt comparison. Klingons. Romulans. Humans. All so easy to manipulate and infect.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_07":"Why, do you know the Klingons thought I was a human? The Romulans as well.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_08":"And I’m guessing you’re not?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_09":"Hardly, Doctor McCoy. Don't you recognize your former patient?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_10":"Wait... that voice!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m5_story04_11":"Don't you recognize KHAN NOONIEN SINGH?!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_01":"So... my Federation friends. At last we meet face-to-face.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_02":"Khan. Only someone as arrogant as you would attempt to manipulate three entire races.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_03":"You do me an injustice, Doctor. My goal was simply to provide  the parasites with new homes. Surely a medic such as yourself can appreciate that.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_04":"Those “homes” are living beings!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_05":"The weak are often work horses for their superiors. Your Federation should understand that by now.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_post_01":"That man was not human.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_post_02":"In more ways than one. All that strength, that raw power...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_post_03":"AND he had one of the Reactors. Every time we’ve shifted into a new reality, it’s like they’ve been placed in our path. We need to figure out why....","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_post_04":"I don’t want to alarm anyone but… is it me, or is the room getting darker?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_post_05":"You’re right, Doctor! Something is happening!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle10_post_06":"Energy readings are spiking!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle11_01":"...apting translation modulation to match species X455 and X478.  Colloquial terminology ‘Human’ and ‘Klingon’.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle11_02":"I don’t believe that’s Khan, anymore.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle11_03":"Collapse of Reality Sphere imminent. Surrender the Reactor to me. Know that your sacrifice will be honored.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle11_post_01":"I’ve scanned his body. We can investigate whatever that was once we’re back on the <i>Artemis</i>.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_battle11_post_02":"I suggest we hurry. This… “Reality Sphere” - as that thing called it - could collapse at any moment!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration01_01":"He'll be past these doors... We might be able to use our phasers to cut through them, but it will be VERY time consuming.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration01_02":"And would eliminate any chance we have to surprise him. There's got to be another way in.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration01_03":"There’s an unconscious officer in the corner...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Ah, an emergency door for the occupants of the bunker to escape through. Sort of obvious, now that I think about it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration01_reaction01_02":"One must always secure a path to retreat, Doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration01_reaction01_03":"Retreat? I thought you Klingons didn't believe in the concept.  All... 'death before dishonor' and all that.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration01_reaction01_04":"You've obviously never tried to woo a Klingon woman before. Retreat is... Occasionally advisable.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration01_reaction03_01":"Nky'argh Li! Tketh Nya!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration01_reaction03_02":"There goes any hope of not attracting attention...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration02_01":"Another filtration unit. Doctor, you wouldn't happen to have any more of the antidote with you?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_exploration02_02":"Oh, I'm sure I could whip up the last batch. Just for old times’ sake.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_story01_01":"Ah, and here you are. I... don't know most of you. Some of you though I do recognize.  Hello, Doctor McCoy.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_story01_02":"Perhaps now you're wishing you had finished me off when I was in your","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_story01_03":"I'm a doctor, not an executioner. Can't help but wish someone had knocked some damn sense into you, though!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_story01_04":"Alas. Farewell, Doctor. I doubt we will speak again.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_story01_05":"Did you notice the thing in his hand?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_story01_06":"A Reactor. That means another gateway… and those creatures can’t be far behind.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_story01_07":"Well... when we find Khan, we should just ask for it nicely. I’m sure he’ll give it to us.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_story01_08":"We need to confront him, but he's sealed himself in the heart of the complex, deep inside the bunker. We need to get into it somehow.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e4_m6_story01_09":"Hmmm... Beaming in won't work. Those things are shielded to prevent direct access.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_battle01_01":"Hang on. I get the feeling we're being watched.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_battle01_02":"You are. Come to finish your dirty work?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_battle01_post_01":"What do you think they meant? 'Our dirty work?'","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_battle01_post_02":"Perhaps they blame us for the failure of their ship?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_battle03_01":"Ahead. More scouts. I thought this was meant to be neutral territory.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_battle03_02":"Not today apparently.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_battle03_03":"Indeed. It looks like we're not the only group hunting for the ship.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_battle08_01":"Starfleet conspirators! Stop them before they threaten the craft!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_battle08_post_01":"More scouts?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_battle08_post_02":"Unlikely. My guess is that they're the crew of the fallen ship.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration01_01":"Wait. There's something toxic in the air.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration01_02":"My tricorder's picking up unusual amounts of ammonia and carbon monoxide. Whatever those mushrooms are spewing out is deadly.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration01_reaction01_01":"We need to find another way through.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration01_reaction01_02":"Let's backtrack - there's probably a better route through all these trees.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration01_reaction02_01":"Bah. I do not fear a little poison. It can’t be worse than a night spent drinking Chech'tluth!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration01_reaction02_02":"I’ll take your word for it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration01_reaction03_01":"Medi-gel that should reduce the effects of the gas... ah. There we go!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_01":"Stop right there.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_02":"Great... there's a welcoming party.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_03":"Welcoming? Unlikely, after you shot our ship down!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_04":"Us? We're just here to offer assistance. The Federation saw your ship's trajectory, witnessed a flare and assumed there'd been a malfunction.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_05":"Malfunction!? We were on a routine patrol when we encountered one of your vessels moving through the upper atmosphere.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_06":"Before we could hail them, they opened fire, crippling our engines!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_07":"Well, it wasn't us.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_08":"If not you... who?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_reaction01_01":"That's what we'd like to know. Stand down and we can figure this out together.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_reaction01_02":"She speaks the truth. After all, do you believe a Federation vessel would really be able to down a Bird-of-Prey so easily?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_reaction01_03":"Hmmm... You make a good point.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_reaction02_01":"I've got a bad feeling about this.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_reaction02_02":"Bad feeling? Are you planning something, human? Maybe attack us while we're injured?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_reaction02_03":"Wait... no! We're just trying to...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_exploration02_reaction02_04":"Bah. We can question them once they're subdued.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_01":"I appreciate your response. I had no idea a Federation ship was in the neighborhood.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_02":"Have you been trapped here in the Nexus like us?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_03":"I’m not sure I follow you…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_04":"Burnham, it appears this Janeway and her crew are creations of the Nexus. But they are no doubt our best chance to locate the next reactor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_05":"What’s the situation on the ground?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_06":"We have a potential powder keg between us and the Klingon forces on this planet.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_07":"Xaxos 7 is a designated neutral territory, claimed by both sides. Both maintain small outposts on the surface but each rarely comes into contact with one another.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_08":"The Klingons avoid us, we avoid them, and peace prevails. Until recently, at least. Voyager answered a distress call from the Federation outpost here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_09":"Our probes picked up what appeared to be a Klingon ship approaching the colony . Before we could hail them, it exploded and crashed in neutral territory.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_10":"You can understand the sensitive nature of this. We want to know what happened and, if possible, offer assistance.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_11":"For all we know this was the prelude to an attack.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_12":"Can't you just beam over to the crash site?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_13":"As your ship's scanners have probably noticed, any attempt to beam seems distorted by the unique magnetic field of the planet.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story01_14":"Fair enough. If we want to investigate the crash, we'll have to do it on foot.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story02_01":"Over there! Is that the ship?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story02_02":"It'd have to be a pretty small ship if it was. I think it's just debris, nothing more.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story02_03":"Definitely Klingon in design. Hmmm... from the looks of it, it appears to be part of a Bird-of-Prey. It must have broken off when the vessel was descending.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story02_04":"Then we're close. And judging from the way the ground is torn up, the ship must have been falling towards the east. C'mon.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story03_01":"So, what happened here? The Federation saw your ship's trajectory, witnessed a flare and assumed there'd been a malfunction.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story03_02":"Malfunction!? Hardly. We were on a routine patrol when we encountered a vessel moving through the upper atmosphere.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story03_03":"Before we could hail them, they opened fire, crippling our engines!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story03_04":"I assume you fought back?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story03_05":"Of course, boy. We fought back hard enough to bring them down as well, but not before they knocked us out of the sky.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story03_06":"Until now I assumed it was the Federation breaking the truce. But... if I'm wrong...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m1_story03_07":"Then there's someone else on the planet. Someone hostile to you... and most likely us.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle01_01":"Huh... Federation. You're a long way from home.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle01_02":"Cardassians! Although, from the looks of it, not ones allied with their Empire.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle01_03":"Mercenaries! Looks like Janeway's intel about groups of bandits operating on the planet was accurate.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle05_01":"Ahead of us! Phaser blasts!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle05_02":"And someone shouting in Klingon!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle05_03":"These are Klingons alright. And looks like they're under attack from mercenaries!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle05_04":"Need a hand?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle05_05":"From the Federation? Bah... It shames me, but we will accept your help.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle06_01":"Hold your ground! Use any cover you can and don't let them draw you out!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle07_01":"They're charging right at us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle07_02":"Get ready. Phasers on full!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle08_01":"I could have sworn I heard voices near here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle08_02":"Fan out... It could be either the Federation or Klingons.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle08_03":"Hold your position... steady... steady.... Now!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle10_01":"This must be the mercenaries' main camp.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle10_02":"If we move quickly, we’ll be able to get the drop on them!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle12_01":"WE ARE THE BORG. YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle12_02":"Just as friendly as the ones we met before, eh?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle12_03":"But they seem more... animated! The other ones were decaying.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle12_post_01":"Is that sphere the source of the message?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle12_post_02":"Yes. Now that I know its origin I can attempt to decode it…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle12_post_03":"PLANETARY SPHERE IDENTIFIED. RESISTANCE, MINIMAL. CHANCE OF ASSIMILATION 99.988999%.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle12_post_04":"Ugh... so it's not alone.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle12_post_05":"Unfortunately, not. If I'm right, something's been replying to the device. And those replies have been getting faster and faster. Almost as if...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_battle12_post_06":"A Borg ship is on its way here!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration01_01":"Okay... I'm completely lost. All I see is trees, trees and more trees.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration01_02":"Well... we're obviously... huh. Okay. Even the path has vanished.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration01_03":"Is the signal still broadcasting?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration01_04":"Yes. Right through that mass of foliage. I'm not sure there's a direct route to it though.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Nothing a few phasers blasts can't solve.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration01_reaction01_02":"Just aim carefully. The last thing we want to do is start a fire!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration01_reaction02_01":"We could probably just use phasers to cut through the trees.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration01_reaction02_02":"And risk starting a fire? Let's backtrack. There's got to be an easier way through.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_01":"More of that alien debris ahead.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_02":"And more of those mercenaries! It looks like they've set up camp nearby and plan to seize whatever crashed near here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_reaction01_01":"More patrols could be here at any moment.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_reaction01_02":"You're right. We should hunker down here and get ready for any attack","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_reaction02_01":"We need to find a way of dealing with the mercenaries.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_reaction02_02":"No, first we need to heal the injured.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_reaction02_03":"No one's bleeding out while I'm here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_reaction03_01":"More mercenaries could be here at any moment.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_reaction03_02":"Let's head them off before they arrive. If we can find a good spot near the clearing, we can get the jump on them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_reaction04_01":"The longer we sit around talking, the more of an advantage these dogs have. I say we take the fight to them now.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_reaction04_02":"Bones? Aren't you going to argue with him?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration02_reaction04_03":"Me? God no. These thugs are a menace. The sooner we deal with them the better!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration03_01":"I KNEW I'd seen that alien tech before. It's Borg!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration03_02":"So that thing over there, that half buried sphere...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_exploration03_03":"Is a Borg Probe. And where one goes, more will follow.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story01_01":"Can our ship scan the surface and see anything?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story01_02":"The Artemis is reporting that the magnetic field surrounding Xaxos 7 is still rendering most long-range scans useless.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story01_03":"Still... we might have more luck running a localized scan. Hmmm....","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story01_04":"Well don't keep us in suspense. Anything?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story01_05":"Just background noise... chatter from the Federation base... huh. Several mercenary broadcasts coming out of the planet's wastelands.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story01_06":"Wait. That's odd.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story01_07":"You've found something?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story01_08":"Maybe? I'm picking up what sounds like a repeating set of numbers, trillions of digits broadcasting incredibly quickly. This could be them!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story01_09":"Great. Lead on!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story02_01":"More debris up ahead.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story02_02":"No, it's not the same. It's not Klingon wreckage. It looks... odd. Sharper, somehow. This must be from whatever the Klingons fought.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story02_03":"It's too damaged to make out much, but you're right. It's definitely not Federation.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story02_04":"Cardassian maybe? The mercenaries operating in this region might have a ship.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story02_05":"No. I've seen enough of their vessels to know this is something else. And that worries me.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m2_story02_06":"C'mon. The signal is stronger here, so we're moving in the right direction.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle01_01":"Their ship's the size of an Earth city. I knew they were advanced but... I had no idea they were this powerful.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle01_02":"RESISTANCE IS FUTILE. WE ARE THE BORG. YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle01_03":"And so loud! C'mon, we need to find Seven of Nine before these things overwhelm us.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle11_01":"Help... me. Help... THE COLLECTIVE REQUIRES YOU REJOI... they're eating away… at my mind… YOU WILL BE REASSIMILATED INTO SERVE UNIMATRIX ZERO ONE…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle11_02":"They've begun the re-assimilation. If we don't stop it immediately, they'll harvest everything she knows and crack the base open like an egg!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle11_03":"Well, what are we waiting for?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle11_post_01":"My... thanks. For a moment I could feel my thoughts slipping away…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle11_post_02":"That must have been horrible.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle11_post_03":"Yes. But also... tempting. There is a certain... peace in the Collective, Doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle11_post_04":"Well, you'll have to stick with our little collective for now, Seven.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_battle11_post_05":"That will be... very satisfactory.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_01":"This is insane. We need to get out of here!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_02":"Stop being a coward. The Federation defenses are down and they're all busy fighting these robots.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_03":"We'll never get a better chance to loot their tech than now.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_04":"... ... are they trying to steal from the base while the Borg are invading? Really?!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Follow me. We'll run them off before they can do any real damage.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_reaction02_01":"We don't have time for this. C'mon. We can deal with them later.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_reaction03_01":"So... ready to fight us properly, eh?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_reaction03_02":"What's wrong with you?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_reaction03_03":"... what?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_reaction03_04":"See that above us? That's the real threat!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_reaction03_05":"They don't care who's fighting who down here. They plan on assimilating us all.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_reaction03_06":"Federation, Klingon, mercenaries like yourselves... it makes no difference to these monsters.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_reaction03_07":"You want to die? Fine. Stay and keep looting.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration01_reaction03_08":"But if you want to live, either help or run off home!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration02_01":"Damnit. This way's blocked.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration02_02":"A security protocol must be in effect. It will have sealed all the entrances to repel any invaders.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration02_03":"Unfortunately, it's keeping us out as well. Solutions, gentlemen?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration02_reaction01_01":"I suspect the codes locking the door are similar to ones I've used before on the Enterprise.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration02_reaction01_02":"Give me a moment and I should be able to bypass them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration02_reaction02_01":"Let's just burn the lock out.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration02_reaction02_02":"A very... Klingon solution, Doctor. I didn't know you had it in you.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration02_reaction02_03":"I've been around Kirk long enough to know sometimes the best way forward is the direct approach.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_exploration02_reaction03_01":"Nothing? Let's backtrack.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story01_01":"... can anyone hea.... me? *crackle* Under attack!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story01_02":"We're reading you, Captain.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story01_03":"We need help immediately! A Borg Cube has appeared overhead. We're fighting back but drones are already assimilating hundreds here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story01_04":"Worse, we've lost communications with Seven of Nine. She has access to all the base's defensive codes!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story01_05":"If they've re-assimilated her, the Borg will be able to use that knowledge to crack us open like an egg!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story01_06":"Focus on saving as many of your troops as you can. We'll find her!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story02_01":"Over there! More survivors.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story02_02":"Good to see you once more. I was worried we'd lost you when communications went down.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story02_03":"Here and ready to help, ma'am. What do you need?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story02_04":"Let's get these civilians beamed up to that fancy ship of yours.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story02_05":"You and I... we need to rescue Seven of Nine.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story02_06":"You found her then?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story02_07":"Her comm signals just ahead but her vitals are going crazy. I think the Borg have her.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m3_story02_08":"Then we need to get to her quickly. C'mon!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle01_01":"I will never get used to these Borg structures.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle01_02":"We must find our bearings and eliminate these drones!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle03_01":"STOP. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE. ASSIMILATION IS CERTAIN.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle07_01":"I'm picking up a significant number of energy signatures ahead of us.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle07_02":"I'm assuming it’s more Borg?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle07_03":"Almost certainly. Judging by their positions, it appears to be a group gathered in some sort of defensive formation.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle07_04":"Defensive or not - we need to get through.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle13_01":"There's our target","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle13_02":"Hmm, I can see some of the damage Seven of Nine mentioned.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle13_03":"They’re pretty far along in the repair and restoring their ability to connect to the Collective.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle13_04":"INTRUDER DETECTED IN RELAY STATION 677-BX3. COUNTER MEASURES DEPLOYING.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle13_post_01":"That's the last of the Drones.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle13_post_02":"Hardly, there surely are more on the way. We must disable the relay before they arrive.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_battle13_post_03":"And stopping them from calling over their buddies.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration01_01":"Take a look at this device here. Stands out, don’t you think?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration01_02":"Good eye, Doctor. This appears to be a data distribution node. There's a flood of information flowing through it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration01_03":"Anything we can use to our advantage?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration01_reaction01_01":"This is definitely curious.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration01_reaction01_02":"The suspense is killing me?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration01_reaction01_03":"We learned the Borg are a part of a hive-mind, meaning all their Cubes are interconnected","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration01_reaction01_04":"This Cube has been damaged and disconnected from the Collective at some point. They’re attempting to establish contact.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration01_reaction01_05":"Meaning our window of opportunity is closing fast!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration01_reaction02_01":"I think I can use this to relay a signal to the drones aboard the Cube that will prevent them from attacking us.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration01_reaction02_02":"I expect the anomaly I created will be repaired soon, but this buys us some time.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_01":"Ahead of us are those recharging stations we’ve encountered before but…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_02":"...Far more functional. Are they awake?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_03":"They're in statis while they connect to the collective.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_04":"Ugh... I feel like we’re at the center of a hornet’s nest. One move and the entire thing will swarm.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_reaction01_01":"I suggest a swift attack.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_reaction01_02":"Attack? You're crazy, man. They'll tear us apart.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_reaction01_03":"I suspect their arousal won’t be so rapid, giving us a significant advantage.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_reaction02_01":"If that’s a recharging station, it needs power to… well, recharge, right?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_reaction02_02":"I follow. There may be means of powering them down. An intriguing suggestion, Doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_reaction02_03":"Ugh... don’t say it like that. You sound just like your brother.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration02_reaction03_01":"We need to retreat. If we raise an alarm, we'll never get further into this vessel.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration03_01":"This looks like another one of those data-majigs.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration03_02":"I could see what we could do with this one…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration03_reaction01_01":"We should press on, playing around with the thing could bring the entire Collective down on our heads.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration03_reaction02_01":"I’m going to give it a good phaser blast? Perhaps that will disrupt communications within the Cube.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration03_reaction03_01":"I should be able to manipulate it so the drones don’t react to our presence.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration03_reaction04_01":"Can we DE-charge the Re-charge?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_exploration03_reaction04_02":"Disable them so the drones in stasis don’t wake up on us? I believe I can.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story01_01":"My thanks for the rescue.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story01_02":"Of course. I only regret that you had to suffer at their hands.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story01_03":"It was... instructive.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story01_04":"While I was linked once again to the collective, I saw the breadth of their plans for this planet.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story01_05":"Despite their overwhelming power, the Cube we're fighting is merely a scout ship.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story01_06":"If we fail in destroying it, we risk it alerting the others.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story01_07":"Yeah, we don’t need any more guests at this party.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story01_08":"They'll use Xaxos 7 as a beachhead and devastate the quadrant.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story01_09":"The Cube is too heavily shielded for us to attack directly. Our best approach would be to disable the Cube from within.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_01":"Hold on. I recognize this device.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_02":"Oh? Well don't keep us in suspense, man.  What is it?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_03":"I believe this is a I data distribution node; an access directly into the Cube’s logs.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_04":"Interesting. Let’s see… Huh.  That’s odd.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_05":"Something wrong?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_06":"Not exactly.  The Node has logs on hundreds of planets all assimilated like they're trying to do with this one.  Then… it looks like they encountered something that bit back.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_07":"Another race?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_08":"It’s saying 01110100 01101000 01100101 00100000 01100100 01110010 01100101 01100001 01101101 01101100 01100101 01110011 01110011 - Binary Code.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_09":"If I'm reading this right it means ‘the Dreamless’.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_10":"And after that, everything is scrambled.  All log entries and dates are corrupted and out of place. Measurements are wrong.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_11":"Almost as if the laws of physics just collapsed all around them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m4_story02_12":"Great.  Another mysterious thing to worry about!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_battle05_01":"SIGNAL DETECTED IN SECTION 6-XB6. INVESTIGATE AND ELIMINATE INTRUDERS.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_battle05_02":"More alarms. I think they’re onto us.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_battle11_01":"STAY WHERE YOU ARE. ASSIMILATION COMMENCING.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_battle11_02":"Well, we gave it one heck of a shot, but I think we may have really angered them this time.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_battle12_01":"YOUR EFFORTS ARE FUTILE. ALL WILL BE ASSIMILATED.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_battle12_02":"This drone must be the Cube's commander.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_battle12_03":"That isn’t a drone, is… Jean-Luc Picard.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_battle12_04":"He was captured by the Borg once and assimilated, but we had rescued him! We brought him back!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_battle12_05":"Snap out of it, man! That's not your captain. Just some nightmare the Nexus has dreamt up.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_battle12_06":"THERE IS NO DREAMING IN THE COLLECTIVE. WE ARE NOT NIGHTMARES. WE ARE REALITY. SUBMIT.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_01":"Klingons are already here?!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_02":"More likely recent captives of the Borg. Notice the forcefield keeping them in place.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_03":"Less noticing, more captive freeing.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Hmmm... The shield appears to be operating on a modulating frequency.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_reaction01_02":"Which would mean we can’t disable it without knowing the pattern used in its activation.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_reaction01_03":"Perhaps, but we can overload it by concentrating our phaser fire at one point.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_reaction02_01":"Can we disable it?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_reaction02_02":"Give me a moment, I might be able to bring it down temporarily.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_reaction03_01":"That's going to be impossible to punch through without setting off an alarm.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_reaction03_02":"I agree with your assessment. How about a power outage, though?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration01_reaction03_03":"Interesting thought. Since the Borg Cube is already diverting power towards sections that require repair, maybe I can manipulate it into routing power away from the forcefield.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_01":"This place is a maze and its shielding is preventing us from beaming to safety.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_02":"I don’t suppose they have a schematic of this place? You know, something they hand out to prospective buyers?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_03":"I can connect to one of the data distribution nodes and trace the circuitry it's connected to in order to create a rough layout of the Cube.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_04":"Let me see... This is so alien it is almost impossible to understand.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_05":"Can we get a general idea of where we are?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_06":"Scans show we're close to the center of the structure.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_reaction01_01":"Let me see... This is so alien it's almost impossible to understand.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_reaction01_02":"Can we at least get a general idea of where we are?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_reaction01_03":"Scans show we're close to the center of the structure.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_reaction02_01":"This relay is unlike any I've seen before. Whatever information is inside, I’d need hours to try and access it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration02_reaction02_02":"Hours we don't have. We'll have to hope we're heading in the right direction.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration03_01":"More captives. We must free them if this Cube is to be destroyed!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration03_02":"You think the same tactic will work again? Aren't these fellas constantly upgrading to adapt to threats?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration03_03":"Hopefully not that quickly, especially being cut off from the Collective.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration03_reaction01_01":"Let’s overload the forcefield with our phasers' fire.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration03_reaction02_01":"You’ve shown a knack for making machines do your bidding, Michael.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration03_reaction02_02":"I might be able to remodulate the field for a moment...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_exploration03_reaction03_01":"I’ll reroute power away from the forcefield.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_story01_01":"I'm getting a transmission from the Artemis. Reinforcements have arrived!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_story01_02":"What?! We just risked life and limb to stop that from happening!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_story01_03":"Not theirs, Doctor, ours! The <i>Artemis</i> is reporting waves of Federation and Klingon vessels exiting warp and attacking the cube.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_story01_04":"The onslaught is working. The Cube has left low orbit and is starting to retreat back into deep space.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_story01_05":"Success?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_story01_06":"Indeed! I suggest we start our own retreat!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_story02_01":"We’re getting incoming communication from the Artemis.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_story02_02":"They’re saying the Cube is badly damaged. It's rapidly retreating from the attacking fleet.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_story02_03":"I suspect the Cube is attempting to return to the Collective physically.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m5_story02_04":"If they manage to do this, the Borg will know the location of the Xaxos 7 and her colonists. We can’t let that happen.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle02_01":"There's so many of them....","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle02_02":"I believe the human phrase “the more the merrier”.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle02_03":"Yeah, that’s not what it’s about.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle05_01":"Follow me! See if you can get past them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle05_02":"There's a gap over there.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle05_03":"When you say 'gap'...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle05_04":"I mean significantly less than the horde behind us. That'll do!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle11_post_01":"More of them! They're endless!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle11_post_02":"This is a fully functional Cube. Perfect in form and function.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle11_post_03":"It is 27 kilometers of passages and rooms, contained within a precise geometric shape.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle11_post_04":"And within those are a complement of 178,456 active drones remaining.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle11_post_05":"I don't like those odds.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle11_post_06":"You WILL BE ASSIMILATED!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle12_01":"We've neutralized your drones. Stand down!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle12_02":"Drones? WE ARE BORG.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle12_03":"ALL IS BORG. YOU HAVE DEFEATED NOTHING MORE THAN STRANDS WITHIN THE GLORY THAT IS THE COLLECTIVE!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle12_04":"Okay... I think we made her angry.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle12_05":"YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED. YOU WILL JOIN THE COLLECTIVE AND ALL WILL BE AT PEACE AND WELL!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle12_post_01":"I thought she'd never stop.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle12_post_02":"Despite her claims to being a mere part of a whole, I think her defeat is causing the Cube to power down.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle12_post_03":"And I'm picking up a signal from the Artemis! They’re in range.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle12_post_04":"Let's grab that Reactor and beam out of here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_battle12_post_05":"Not just yet. If we reroute the warp core's energy into a loop, we might be able to cripple the Cube... permanently.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_01":"Still you scurry around in the shadows, struggling against the inevitable.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_02":"I was hoping we'd be able to avoid detection for longer.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_03":"She's everywhere, every part of the circuitry around us. We need to keep moving.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_04":"To what end, “Worf”?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_05":"We like this one - this ”Worf”. Strong and able-bodied. You will make a fine addition to the Collective.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_06":"And your mind will reveal much about your race when you're assimilated.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_07":"For all her pride in being efficient and cold, she’s pretty fond of theatrics!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_08":"She has her drones surrounding us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_reaction01_01":"We have to keep going. If we retreat, she'll be able to pick us off in the tunnels.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_reaction01_02":"You're a special kind of reckless, aren't you, man?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_reaction01_03":"I, sir, am a Klingon!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_reaction01_04":"Well, the two aren’t mutually exclusive.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_reaction02_01":"We have to keep going!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration01_reaction02_02":"That's suicide! Back up. There's less of them behind us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration02_01":"Major security here, and a forcefield up. No doubt this facility is of high importance.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration02_02":"There’s a major energy reading beyond this barrier. It would be safe to assume it’s the Cube’s warp core.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration02_reaction01_01":"Have a look around. This ship is so modular, there might well be another entrance we've overlooked.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration02_reaction02_01":"Hmmm... I don't see anything that resembles an energy modulator. It's impossible to ascertain where the barrier’s generation point is.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration02_reaction02_02":"We'll have to try further afield. If we can access a nearby node, we might be able to shut down all the power in the vicinity.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_01":"This must be the Cube's warp core!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_02":"It's magnificent... and terrifying.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_03":"Is it me or is that one of those Nexus Reactors that we’ve been finding?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_04":"You’ve come upon more of these, “Doctor McCoy”? I’d be most interested to relieve you of their possession. This one has proven to be an energy source like no other.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_05":"The shield just went up behind us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_06":"You don't think we’d want you leaving, do you?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_07":"You've shown yourselves to be rare flesh forms. Creative, intelligent and determined.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_08":"And your “Artemis” is running a technology that will be a fine addition to the Collective.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_09":"The hell it will!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_reaction01_01":"More drones! We need to use a more robust approach.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_reaction01_02":"Adjust your phaser frequencies. We need to overwhelm them before they can adapt.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_reaction02_01":"Backs together. Don't let them flank us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_reaction02_02":"YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_reaction03_01":"More drones...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_reaction03_02":"Well... perhaps today IS a good day to die!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_exploration03_reaction03_03":"You’ve been saying that a little too often...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story01_01":"Well, aren’t you a resourceful pest?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story01_02":"Someone is transmitting on our comms. I can't block it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story01_03":"Your machines are already part of the Collective. Your bodies and minds will soon follow.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story01_04":"You may already know, but it bears repeating that resistance is futile. You only need to submit and be fulfilled.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story01_05":"Sounds like you don't know much about the Federation if you simply expect us to roll over on your command!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story01_06":"Roll over, play dead. We are Borg. Your actions have only delayed the inevitable. When we return to the Collective you will be... *hiss*","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story01_07":"I've managed to mask our signal for now.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story01_08":"I had heard that voice before, or at least one like it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story01_09":"It’s now obvious why this Cube is still active. The drones will not rest until we remove their Queen...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_01":"There’s another one of those data nodes. Might be useful, if we’ve got time to scan it, that is.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_02":"Step aside, Doctor.  This shouldn't take too long.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_03":"Anything useful?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_04":"Again, the code’s corrupted like the one we found earlier.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_05":"Some sort of virus perhaps? They are similar to synthetics in many ways…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_06":"That’s… actually a fairly accurate description of what I'm looking at.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_07":"Before the Cube was damaged, everything was normal. Afterwards, it’s jumbled. At first I thought it was just numerology. Dates and distances.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_08":"But now? It’s more than that.  The code has bits of random text everywhere. Alien languages unlike anything I've ever seen.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_09":"If I didn't know better I'd say it was like the data had been overwritten by thousands of different voices.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_10":"Given how these things harvest people, is that so surprising? Maybe their old personalities got free?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story02_11":"Possibly, Doctor.  It’s just… odd. Very odd. And in the Nexus that makes me uncomfortable!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story04_01":"There’s an opening in the wall here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story04_02":"Possibly a maintenance corridor that’s gone abandoned.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story04_03":"Abandoned? The Borg don't strike me as the type who waste anything.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story04_04":"Come, Doctor. Where is your sense of adventure?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story04_05":"Back on the Artemis. However, I do have a hearty dollop of “I told you so” ready to be served at a moment’s notice.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story05_01":"Here it is. Let me see if I can remodulate the input.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story05_02":"Dimming lights are a good indication that you did it!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e5_m6_story05_03":"Let's get to the warp core before the Queen sends more drones our way.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle01_01":"Ahead of us! <i>Pioneer</i> officers!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle01_02":"Greetings. We're from the <i>U.S.S. Artemis</i>. Do you, ah, require assistance?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle01_03":"*alien babbling*","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle01_04":"That doesn't sound like Federation Standard…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle01_05":"*Urgent alien babble*","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle01_post_01":"Did either of you recognize the language they were speaking? The universal translator was unable to make sense of it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle01_post_02":"You know, when I was studying medicine at the academy, we were shown a video of old Earth “asylums”.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle01_post_03":"Barbaric places where society discarded people. I can't help but be reminded of them by these poor souls.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle03_01":"*Shouts alien babble*","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle03_02":"Stay close! There's more of them ahead!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle03_03":"And they look even less friendly than the last lot.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle06_01":"More infected. A lot more than we’ve seen elsewhere!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle06_02":"Is it me or do they seem like they're clustered in this area?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle06_03":"Perhaps there’s something here they're drawn to?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle06_04":"I'm bringing up the schematics now. There’s the Sickbay… there may be survivors inside!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle06_05":"We won't know for sure unless we find a way to get past the <i>Pioneer’s</i> crew!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle12_post_01":"That turned out better than I'd thought.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle12_post_02":"Let’s get back into the Sickbay.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle13_post_01":"I can't believe we're still alive!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle13_post_02":"Fortune occasionally favors the bold, Doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_battle13_post_03":"Indeed. Now, let's see who it is on the bed.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_01":"There's shielding stopping us going any further.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_02":"It looks like the ship is still partially powered.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_03":"Powered enough to put something in our path!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Perhaps we can access the shield mechanism from that control panel?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_reaction01_02":"Good thinking, Mr. Worf. With a bit of luck, we'll have this down in no time.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_reaction01_03":"Let’s get moving. Standing exposed like this is making me nervous.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_reaction02_01":"If you don't mind a bit of physical exercise, we might be able to bypass it by ducking into that jeffries tube.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_reaction02_02":"That is a… small tube.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_reaction02_03":"Bend at the knees, Worf!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_reaction03_01":"Perhaps we should look for a way around.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration01_reaction03_02":"Agreed!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_01":"Someone is lying on the bed there!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_02":"He must be the one drawing the infected!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_03":"What should we do about them?.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_reaction01_01":"I suggest engaging the stragglers then retreating to the corridor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_reaction01_02":"With luck, they'll follow us, and we'll be able to pick them off one by one, rather than facing down the entire mob.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_reaction01_03":"And here I thought you Klingons never retreated.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_reaction01_04":"We’re warriors, Doctor, not foolhardy idiots.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_reaction02_01":"They're enthralled with that survivor. That gives us the element of surprise.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_reaction02_02":"And the chance to be cannon fodder!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_reaction02_03":"No time to argue, Doctor!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_exploration02_reaction02_04":"Well that’s convenient!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story01_01":"Burnham to <i>Artemis</i>. We've successfully beamed aboard the <i>Pioneer</i>.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story01_02":"Odd. The air smells stale... burnt? Phaser fire perhaps, but I see no obvious signs of a struggle.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story01_03":"Maybe the ship was ambushed and boarded? It might explain where the crew is.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story01_04":"Seems unlikely that a ship of this size could have been caught unaware, but we can't rule anything out.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story01_05":"Wait! I swear I heard something clatter over there...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story02_01":"Those people on the floor ahead. Doctor, are they...?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story02_02":"Afraid so. Phaser burns on all of them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story02_03":"They might have tried to fight back against the infected crew.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story02_04":"This is reminiscent of our time with Dr. Crusher... Come, let’s look for survivors.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_01":"Over there, on the wall. Is that... writing?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_02":"Good eye, Doctor. I nearly missed it in the darkness.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_03":"“My eyes are not my own…”. I can't make out that particular word.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_04":"“In this valley of dying stars. Oh hollow. Oh emp-“. It trails off into unintelligible drivel…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_05":"A warning, perhaps?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_06":"I'm not sure they even knew what was happening to them. This illness seems to eat away at whomever is infected.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_07":"Have you noticed a common thread in all our encounters in the Nexus?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_08":"I was just thinking that, Michael.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_09":"We keep meeting individuals – even machines – overcome by an outside influence.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_10":"Yes. Infected, diseased, malfunctioning, assimilated. A coincidence?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story03_11":"Or perhaps a pattern in all this Nexus chaos…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story04_01":"It appears to be a Starfleet officer. Possibly the former Captain of this ship.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story04_02":"Is he conscious, Doctor? Is he able to speak?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story04_03":"Hold your horses. His life signs are stable, which is a good start.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story04_04":"I’m administering a stimulant!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story04_05":"Who? Wh-where am I?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story04_06":"Woah there. Take it easy, man! You're with friends – we’re of the <i>U.S.S. Artemis</i>. Can you tell me your name?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m1_story04_07":"I... I'm Benjamin Sisko. Acting Captain of the <i>U.S.S. Pioneer</i>.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle01_01":"How’s our patient, Doctor?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle01_02":"As far as I can tell, Captain Sisko’s fine. Scans show no signs of physical or mental trauma.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle01_03":"Listen, Captain, we're here to help. Can you tell us what happened to you?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle01_04":"I... I'm not sure, Doctor. Everything feels blurry. Soft somehow.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle01_05":"I remember a gathering somewhere in space. Maybe some kind of reception? I was speaking to a Klingon, and then there was a commotion.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle01_06":"Doctor, but we have company!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle02_01":"*Maddening alien noise*","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle02_02":"That sound… that’s what people on the ship sounded like as they were being infected!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle02_03":"It was terrible. I heard them crying out, then their voices turned low and guttural.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle02_04":"Here they come!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle08_01":"The turbolift should be straight ahead.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle08_02":"Along with what looks like half of your crew! They’re clustered around it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle08_03":"We must get past them if we want to retake the bridge. Follow me!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle08_04":"I commend your enthusiasm, Captain!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle09_01":"No! No! Stay back! Stay… aghhhhhh!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle09_02":"Over there! That’s my first officer!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle09_03":"<i>*alien scream*</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle09_04":"My god. That poor devil’s already been corrupted. This virus is unlike anything I've ever seen before!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle09_05":"We can try and treat her later, Doctor. For now, we need to stay alive!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle09_06":"On my left! Drive them away from the controls!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_battle10_01":"The infected are everywhere! Look out!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_01":"We’re cornered inside the Sickbay. More of them will be coming.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction01_01":"You're right, Doctor. We need to keep moving.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction01_02":"Captain. Can you recall whether the bridge was compromised?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction01_03":"I... No. I remember it being evacuated. I'm sure it's locked down. If we can make it there, we should be safe.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction01_04":"More importantly, you mentioned attending a gathering somewhere when the outbreak began. If we can access the navigational logs, we might be able to find out where that was.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction02_01":"Just give me a moment. I might be able to gather some medical supplies.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction02_02":"Good thinking, Doctor. I suspect those will come in handy.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction03_01":"If the computer's still working, we might find out what's going on. Let’s see if this part of the Nexus recognizes my credentials.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction03_02":"Computer, identification: McCoy, Dr. Leonard.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction03_03":"Identification: Leonard Horatio McCoy. Chief Medical Officer of the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i>, NCC-1701.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction03_04":"Welcome aboard, Dr. McCoy. How may I be of service?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction03_05":"Anything useful in the files?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction03_06":"Apparently, the infection began three days ago and spread to most of the crew. Symptoms included odd behavior, confusion and terror.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration01_reaction03_07":"Hmmm, now this is interesting. I tried finding out where the ship was infected. All I get is <i>“classified”</i>.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_01":"Does this door here lead to the bridge?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_02":"To the crew's quarters. Perhaps more of my people have taken shelter in there!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction01_01":"Let's see if my old <i>Enterprise</i> security clearance will work here… Success!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction01_02":"That's odd. A security clearance shouldn't work between ships.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction01_03":"We'll have to explain some other time, but this is a… unique… environment.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction01_04":"more casualties…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction01_05":"This is devastating.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction01_06":"There is nothing we can do for them. We should gather supplies and leave.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction02_01":"Give me a moment. I should be able to disable the door mechanism.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction02_02":"More casualties…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction02_03":"This is devastating.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction02_04":"There is nothing we can do for them. We should gather supplies and leave.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction03_01":"Unfortunately, Captain, we don't have time to spare trying to get this open. Getting to the bridge takes priority.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration02_reaction03_02":"You're right, of course. Follow me. The turbolift to the forward deck is this way.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_01":"They're retreating, but it looks like the controls have been damaged.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_02":"With the shields still up, the <i>Artemis</i> won't be able to beam us directly to the bridge.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_03":"Well, we're going to need a new plan. Suggestions?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_reaction01_01":"While my memory is spotty, I can still remember the override.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_reaction01_02":"With a bit of luck, I should be able to get the turbolift to work.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_reaction01_03":"Excellent! Let's get out of here before we're surrounded.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_reaction02_01":"If we can pry open the doors, we can climb directly to the bridge.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_reaction02_02":"That is… a lot of climbing.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_reaction02_03":"This is why I always insist on everyone passing their regular physicals!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_reaction03_01":"It's too badly damaged, but there’s another route to the bridge.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_reaction03_02":"I should warn you. Be prepared for a lot of climbing...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_exploration03_reaction03_03":"Just when I thought this day couldn't get any better...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story01_01":"I... I remember running down this corridor before.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story01_02":"Do you recall what you were doing?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story01_03":"I was... I was looking down at myself. I... I know that doesn't make any sense.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story01_04":"It was as if I was outside my body, watching myself run. It was chaos, crew everywhere. People struggling and shouting.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story01_05":"I was myself, and then… it was as if I was sharing my body with something else.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story01_06":"I'm sorry you had to go through something so terrifying, Captain.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story01_07":"Thank you, Doctor. Please, let’s keep going.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story02_01":"We should be safe to search through the logs now.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story02_02":"<i>Captain's Log. Stardat-... *crackle*.

I don't recognize my own fa- *crackle*</i>","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story02_08":"And that’s all I could find. What happened to you out there, Captain?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m2_story02_09":"I wish I could remember!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle01_01":"*alien ramblings*","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle01_02":"Klingons over there, on the starboard side!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle01_03":"They sound just like the crew of the <i>Pioneer</i>. Whatever they're saying, it's not Klingon.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle01_04":"I think Doctor McCoy was right earlier: there’s no pattern in their utterings that would suggest a cohesive language.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle01_05":"It's like they're as alien to each other as they are to us, struggling to communicate but not sure how.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle01_06":"Let’s stop them killing each other, and then we can discuss the finer points of their dialect!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle02_01":"It looks like we're not the first to make a stand here. This part of the ship is so damaged, it's a wonder there's anything left!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle02_02":"Ahead of us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle02_03":"Concentrate your fire! They're shrugging off all but the heaviest of shots.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle02_04":"They've lost all sense of self-preservation! They're just charging straight towards us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle11_01":"That's the Bridge.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle11_02":"Push through!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_01":"Hah! I THOUGHT one of you sounded like a Klingon. Come in and join the battle!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_02":"Forward! Jagh yIbuStaH!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_03":"I assume that means something… inspirational?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_post_01":"Well fought! I'd be a fool not to be grateful for your timely arrival.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_post_02":"The honor is ours, Captain. What had happened here?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_post_03":"I assume you’re envoys from Captain Sisko's ship - the <i>Pioneer</i>?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_post_04":"No, but we found that ship in a similar condition to your own vessel. Can you tell us what had happened?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_post_05":"We were working to achieve a trade agreement between the Klingon, the Federation and the Cardassian Empire.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_post_06":"We'd convened in neutral space near Shanti 5. Things were... surprisingly agreeable. I found your Captain Sisko an amenable enough host, and our two delegations seemed to get on well enough.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_post_07":"Then the Cardassians arrived. And they brought that... presence with them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_post_08":"Their delegation beamed aboard screaming! Within minutes, the infection spread across my ship!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_battle12_post_09":"If you really want answers, they await you in the Shanti system, on the wreckage of the Cardassian vessel.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration01_01":"We're officially lost.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration01_02":"A Klingon is never lost in a Bird of Prey, Doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration01_03":"By all means, take the lead.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Er, left, I think? Y","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration01_reaction01_02":"You sure? You just hesitated.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration01_reaction01_03":"There was no hesitation, Doctor! Left it is!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration01_reaction02_01":"To the right. I believe. That should take us towards the bridge.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration01_reaction02_02":"You have no idea where you're going, do you?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration01_reaction02_03":"Let’s humor Lt. Worf and proceed to the right.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration02_01":"Hold. Scans are detecting a breach in the corridor ahead.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration02_02":"Someone must have detonated something powerful enough to punch a hole right through the hull of the ship!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration02_03":"Well, this is a fine mess. I don't suppose anyone’s got an EV suit handy?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration02_reaction01_01":"I can try and reroute power to the nearest energy module.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration02_reaction01_02":"With a bit of luck, I can set up a shield over the area so we can pass safely.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration02_reaction02_01":"I don't see any way to repair it. We will need to find another route around.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_01":"This must be the ship's Sickbay.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_02":"More bodies. How horrific.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction01_01":"Well, they didn't do much for these poor souls. What happened here, Doctor? Did they kill each other?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction01_02":"No. I'm not observing any apparent wounds or signs of weapon damage like we saw when we first beamed across.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction01_03":"My tricorder is showing each suffered massive cerebral trauma.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction01_04":"Whatever was inside them, their bodies couldn't handle the strain and collapsed.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction01_05":"This is getting more dire by the minute.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction02_01":"What does it say?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction02_02":"Let me see... It's notes from the ship's Doctor. She's desperate to treat her patients and is trying everything she can think of.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction02_03":"Then she goes on to say Anetrizine has failed as has... something called Tranoline?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction02_04":"Yes, I would have tried the same. What else?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction02_05":"Her final entry describes her suffering what she perceives to be exhaustion. She sees strange patterns and suddenly feels like her hands aren't her own. The log concludes after that..","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction02_06":"So she was infected…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_exploration03_reaction03_01":"Grab anything that may be of use. We must locate Martok.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_story01_01":"Well, we're here. Now what?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_story01_02":"Whatever we do, we must proceed cautiously. I'm picking up damage throughout the ship.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_story01_03":"Serious damage... It looked like firefights broke out throughout the decks.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_story01_04":"And here I assumed it was just part of the decor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_story01_05":"Hold up. I'm receiving a message on comms.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e6_m3_story01_06":"But he’s rather well versed in it. Hold up.

Was the experience similar to what we’ve seen in the Spheres?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story02_06":"No. Holodeck simulations were more akin to... fantasies. Many of them were amusing trifles.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story02_07":"It’s uncommon for them to feel anything like the consuming realities we’ve seen in the Spheres.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story02_08":"That sounds like what the Dreamless would term the experience of the Nexus – “consuming”. They feel it’s more akin to a prison than a fantasy…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_01":"So do we just keep wandering these halls or…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_02":"If we might intrude?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_03":"Behind you! It’s... I'm not sure what it is.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_04":"We are designation ”X'ytakii”, or ”The Caretaker” in your language. We’re one of several prime AIs designed to control the functions of this Reality Engine.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_05":"Our scans show you possess six Reactors and seem determined to defend this structure. Is our assessment accurate?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_06":"Well, we are trying to stop these so-called Dreamless from destabilizing the Nexus.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_07":"That is the function of an “Engineer”. However, you were not trained as Engineers, and we are unable to provide you with authority and tools to repair the Reality Engine and repel the intruders.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_08":"Well, we sure would like to do that, though.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_09":"You may take the test required of any Engineer, but without the proper training, you are likely to fail.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_10":"And if we do?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_11":"Then you will not be granted the corresponding status and will be unable to seal the Engine. And so, the construct and the Spheres it connects will fail in approximately 3.567 of your Terran hours.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m1_story04_12":"You’re not giving us much of a choice then!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_battle01_01":"Halt!

Wait, we’re not…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_battle01_03":"I don't think they're in the mood to listen, Doctor!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_battle07_01":"Do you hear phaser fire ahead of us?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_battle07_02":"You're right. Over there! It looks like the Cardassians are fighting Starfleet officers!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_battle07_03":"I think we know better than believing these are actually Starfleet officers. More likely more shapeshifters.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_battle07_04":"Are you sure, Doctor?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_battle07_05":"Have a little faith in me, Mr. Worf. Ol’ “Bones” McCoy knows what he’s doing.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_battle07_06":"How can you tell, Doctor?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_battle07_07":"Their body language, the awkwardness with which they move.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_battle07_08":"I trust your analysis on this, Doctor. Let us proceed.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration01_01":"Starfleet officers, over here!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration01_02":"Hang on. You're safe now.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration01_reaction01_01":"We’ll be exposed here.

Exterminate them!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration01_reaction02_05":"You’re shapeshifters! You know, the Cardassians have been looking all over for you!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration01_reaction03_01":"Check around. There might be something in the runabout we can use to help them.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration01_reaction03_02":"Good thinking. There are some supplies over here.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration01_reaction03_03":"You Starfleet rats want to steal our stuff?!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration01_reaction03_04":"”Starfleet rats”… Wait, aren’t you…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration01_reaction03_05":"You’re shapeshifters! You know, the Cardassians have been looking all over for you!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration02_01":"It looks like someone abandoned supplies over there. We could use a restock.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration02_reaction01_01":"It couldn't hurt to take a quick look...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration02_reaction01_02":"Get them!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration02_reaction01_03":"Or... maybe it COULD hurt! It's a shapeshifter ambush!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration02_reaction02_01":"So someone just abandoned valuable supplies in the middle of a path? Do we ever get that lucky?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration02_reaction02_02":"The Doctor makes a good point.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_exploration02_reaction02_03":"Sometimes a trap is just too obvious...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_01":"What is this? Are we inside a Sphere?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_02":"You are still inside the Reality Engine, but it's within our parameters to create environments for you to be tested in.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_03":"The Caretaker has taken the form of Captain Sisko…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_04":"We don't have time for this nonsense, man! You just said lives were at stake!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_05":"Correct. It is recommended you make haste.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_06":"I recommend you make haste in explaining what we must do.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_07":"In our study of your memories, we've found the species in your quadrant value certain traits that align with the role of an Engineer.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_08":"The first of these is Faith, as demonstrated by your Captain Sisko.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_09":"You... want us to pray?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_10":"You misunderstand us. Faith not in an omnipresent entity, but in your goal and skills, as well as those of your fellow Engineers.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_11":"It was faith in something greater that allowed the original Engineers to create this place, and so it became a prerequisite for any Engineer that follows.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_12":"A portal awaits you somewhere in this arena - an exit to the next test.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story01_13":"But be wary, nothing you see is what it seems. Only faith in your goal will see you to the end.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story02_01":"It's the Caretaker.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story02_02":"We felt a certain curiosity as to how you are faring.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story02_03":"Let me satisfy your curiosity: we’re in the middle of a war between Cardassians and shapeshifters, and both sides are very trigger happy whenever they see us.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story02_04":"An impossible situation, we agree. It appears the only way out is to turn back.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story02_05":"Turn back? You obviously don't know much about Starfleet!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story04_01":"That must be the portal the Caretaker mentioned.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story04_02":"It is. You have exceeded our expectations with your performance.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story04_03":"You pushed through an impossible situation to meet your goal and put your faith in your ally’s skills.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story04_04":"Such faith is admirable, but can also make an individual blind. However, you do not appear to be driven by greed or lust for power.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story04_05":"So that's it? We've passed your test?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story04_06":"The first part, yes. There are more.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m2_story04_07":"...of course there are.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle01_01":"Hold. Scans are showing movement up ahead. A lot of movement.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle01_02":"We are Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle01_03":"Ugh, can’t they… compute a new form of greeting?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle01_04":"Perhaps you could save the sarcasm for a less precarious moment, Doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle02_01":"This area looks devoid of activity. It should be safe to proceed.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle02_02":"Wait, it's an ambush! I must have triggered the alarm back there!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle02_03":"You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle04_01":"Do you see that silhouette ahead of us?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle04_02":"It's the Borg Queen!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle04_03":"You will be... Assimilated. Resistance is futile.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle04_post_01":"Odd. I’m sure that was the Queen, but she didn't quite sound like the one we'd met before.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle04_post_02":"I don’t know. Sounded like the Queen’s Borgish to me!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle04_post_03":"A backup body, perhaps? Or one of several she can transfer her conscience into?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle04_post_04":"Impossible to know…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_01":"Welcome, all of you. So very far from home.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_02":"Another Borg Queen! Although this one sounds more... real.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_03":"Another? We are Borg. No more, no less. All bodies are mere extensions of our will.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_04":"Even yours. Isn't that right, Locutus?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_05":"Yes. You will be assimilated before the combined might of the collective.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_06":"Today, we fight for a larger, more precious collective, and you will not stand in our way!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_post_01":"We made it! Now where's our trial, mister?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_post_02":"We are here. And we congratulate you on your determination.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_post_03":"Despite being offered respite from this place multiple times, you always chose to press on.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_post_04":"Are we safe now? Are the trials over?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_battle14_post_05":"You are out of harm’s way for the moment, but two more trials await you.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration01_01":"Are we lost?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration01_02":"Are we ever not?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration01_03":"Touché, Michael.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration01_04":"Let’s stop for a moment. I can try accessing this node and find us a route forward.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Any luck?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration01_reaction01_02":"My tricorder is showing a path, but another signal appeared at the same time.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration01_reaction01_03":"Should we be concerned?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration01_reaction01_04":"Maybe not, it seems to have stopped.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration01_reaction02_01":"I feel like we’re better off wandering around blindly than poking inside their system.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration01_reaction02_02":"That seems to irritate them!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration02_01":"There's a recharging alcove over there. An unusual one.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration02_02":"Scans are showing a considerable amount of energy passing through it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration02_03":"It might connect to the Borg network. Worth investigating.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration02_reaction01_01":"I’m overloading it using my tricorder…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration02_reaction01_02":"It’s shifting. Looks like it’s being raised?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration02_reaction01_03":"Likely an automatic system that’s moving it away for repair.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration02_reaction01_04":"Let’s see what’s behind it before the system conveys a recharge station to take its place.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration02_reaction02_01":"Let's leave it and avoid the possibility of being detected.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration02_reaction02_02":"I concur.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration03_01":"I think some of the paneling here is loose…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration03_02":"Well spotted. We might be able to pry it open and see if anything is hidden there.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration03_reaction01_01":"Got it!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration03_reaction02_01":"You want to play mechanic when the stakes are this high?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_exploration03_reaction02_02":"The Doctor has a point. Let’s move on.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story01_01":"Where are we now? This looks like a Borg Cube.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story01_02":"Ugh, no more Borg, please.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story01_03":"This is your second trial.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story01_04":"You appear to us now as Captain Janeway. Is there a reason for that?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story01_05":"In your time, Captain Janeway was renowned for her legendary journey.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story01_06":"Over seven long years, the Captain and her crew traveled from the far side of the Delta quadrant and returned to earth. Such determination.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story01_07":"She is appropriate in representing your next trial: the Test of Will.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story01_08":"The Caretaker vanished… A Borg Cube, a “Test of Will”. I suspect we're going to be fighting every inch of the way!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_01":"I'm exhausted. I need to rest for a moment.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_02":"You would do well to listen to the doctor.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_03":"Agh! Can’t you materialize in front of us instead of behind for once?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_04":"Our apologies. We are only attempting to provide advice.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_05":"By our calculation, you have only been successful in exploring 0.00001% of the Borg Cube in your search for the portal.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_06":"The Reality Engine will collapse soon, and if you are in here when that happens, you will perish.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_07":"We can transport you to safety.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_08":"If the Reality Engine fails, so do the Spheres and all who are inside them!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_09":"We believe you underestimate the size of the Nexus. It is built upon many Engines.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_10":"But each – and this one – is responsible for multitudes of Spheres, correct? And all connected Spheres will fail if we give up now.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_11":"That is correct.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_12":"And the Nexus will deteriorate further, causing all the destructive rifts that are threatening our universe – outside the Nexus…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_13":"Again - correct.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_14":"Then we continue.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_15":"As you wish.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_16":"It's gone.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_17":"I'm impressed, Doctor. I thought you were exhausted a moment ago.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story02_18":"I still am. But we're here to save lives, not complain about a little wear and tear along the way!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story04_01":"Your delicate form appears to have been progressively weathering.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story04_02":"We estimate you would not be able to endure much more of this. We recommend an immediate departure.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story04_03":"Hah! Did Khaless abandon the hunt of his brother, Morath? No, he hunted him across mountain and through valley, for his honor and the honor of their father.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m3_story04_04":"And so, shall we fight through this place and come out triumphant on the other side!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle01_01":"Klingons ahead of us. A lot of them!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle01_02":"Can't you communicate with them, Worf? Tell them to stand down?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle01_03":"bIjeghbe'chugh vaj bIHegh!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle01_04":"Hoch jagh Heghjaj!!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle01_05":"I don’t need to be well-versed in Klingon to guess that didn’t go over well.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle01_06":"They are... not open to negotiation.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle01_post_01":"They're retreating. We're safe for now.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle04_01":"More Klingons! An entire squadron!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle04_02":"So... the Federation has a Klingon pet...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle04_03":"You dare?! I am no one's lapdog! I am a warrior!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle04_04":"Yeah! And now you’ve gone and made him angry. You wouldn’t like him when he’s angry!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle09_01":"More of them?! They're endless.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle09_02":"The Beacon of Khaless is a sacred relic, said to be created by Khaless himself to unite the twenty-four great houses.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle09_03":"To a Klingon, the very presence of an outsider at the Beacon is a high crime – an abomination.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle09_04":"But it was an error! They have admitted as much.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle09_05":"Although my values align with the Federation’s, I still feel my blood boiling over this transgression in instinct.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle09_06":"I understand the logic, of course, but that should give you an understanding of how severe this is for a Klingon.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle09_07":"In your time, Michael, our species went to war because of the relic. Is it any wonder the Klingons fight so fiercely to punish the crew? They will not relent.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle09_post_01":"I'm picking up hundreds more bio-readings converging on our position. We need to retreat!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle09_post_02":"Huh. I thought you'd be arguing for us to stay and fight.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle09_post_03":"As Khaless himself once said, \"The wind does not respect a fool.\"","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_01":"We’re close.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_02":"I'm detecting a mass of Klingon bio-signatures ahead.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_03":"They must have been put in our way to guard the Reactor I’m detecting.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_04":"Hu'tegh! And they're not alone. One of them is wearing the ceremonial armor of the Torchbearer.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_05":"The Klingon champion who defends the Beacon of Khaless! I had a… run in with one.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_06":"And you’re sure you can’t just access the Reactor from here?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_07":"…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_08":"Hmph. Didn’t think so.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_post_01":"We’re right over the source of the signal. I can use my tricorder in conjunction with our Reactors to access it.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_post_02":"The device powering the reality we’re in definitely isn’t of the magnitude of the Reactors powering the Spheres. Which is good news!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_post_03":"So, any ideas as to how to reprogram this scenario so it’s winnable?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_post_04":"I don’t think we need to “win” it. Our goal has always been to find the portal. Yes, it had previously appeared when we “won”, but in this case… why don’t we just make it appear?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_post_05":"Brilliant, Michael!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_battle11_post_06":"One portal coming up!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_01":"There! Injured crew members ahead of us!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_02":"I'll... hang back and let you deal with this. A Klingon showing up might escalate things…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_03":"We’re here to help! Are you all right?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_04":"I... yes. Barely. Who are you? I don't recognize your uniforms.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_05":"We're from the <i>U.S.S. Artemis</i>. What had happened here?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_06":"You're a welcome sight, we’re in dire straits.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_07":"Our route took us close to the Beacon of Khaless.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_08":"The Beacon is a holy relic of the Klingon empire. What were you thinking approaching it?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_09":"It was a mistake! We had no idea what the thing was... but they’re accusing us of aggression and attempting to defile their sacred vessel.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_10":"They announced that everyone on board in sentenced to death!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_reaction01_01":"Well, we can't have that.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_reaction01_02":"We need to get these people to safety. Can you get them ready to move, Doctor?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_reaction01_03":"I'll try. Cover me while I patch them up!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_reaction02_01":"There are Klingons converging on this spot!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration01_reaction02_02":"So, we drive them back. Then we can deal with the wounded.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration02_01":"I’ve locked on a reading akin to the Reactors’. It’s definitely not as considerable, so perhaps this reality isn’t as major as an actual Sphere.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration02_02":"Let’s give your Reactor theory a spin! Do you think you can “reprogram” this door away?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration02_reaction01_01":"Yes! I can use my tricorder in conjunction with our Reactors…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration02_reaction01_02":"I’m accessing the underlining structure of this “reality”. It’s complex, but… give me a few moments.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration02_reaction01_03":"The door disappeared!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration02_reaction01_04":"Incredible.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration02_reaction01_05":"I need to be closer to the signal source to do anything showier than that, though.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration02_reaction02_01":"We should not waste any time or potential Reactor power.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_exploration02_reaction02_02":"Mr. Worf, you are a fine warrior and loyal ally. But you, Sir, are no fun.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_01":"Intriguing! We appear to be on a Federation vessel. Scans showing damage throughout several decks.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_02":"An attack?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_03":"I'm receiving several jumbled messages. It appears Klingons have boarded the ship and taken control of key areas.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_04":"I’ve learned it’s generally safer when Klingons keep their hands off Starfleet ships!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_05":"Present company excluded.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_06":"Hmph.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_07":"And that is the nature of your test.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_08":"Jim?! Wait... you're the Caretaker.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_09":"This test echoes the values your friend possesses in abundance.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_10":"Recklessness? Willingness to drag us all into some fool adventure?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_11":"The test of Cunning lies before you. You have shown a willingness to believe in your goal and to persevere through all odds.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_12":"But some obstacles cannot be beaten head on.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_13":"Find the portal and the end of this trial.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story01_14":"And he's gone. Helpful as ever.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_01":"This seems impossible. It’s a regular… it’s the Kobayashi Maru!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_02":"The academy test?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_03":"Exactly. I assume you've both taken it?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_04":"I have. And, like every other cadet, failed it every time. I was furious when I found out it was a no-win scenario.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_05":"Either you rescue the crew and cause a war with the Klingon empire or abandon them to die.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_06":"This scenario, too, is designed for failure. My people won’t relent here. We won’t survive their onslaught, and if we leave, these people will perish…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_07":"But here's the thing: in my time, Captain Kirk DID beat the Kobayashi Maru test. In good ol’ Jim fashion, he… got creative: he snuck in before the test and reprogrammed the computer.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_08":"So we should take a page out of Captain Kirk’s book and… cheat.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_09":"But how? There’s no computer we have access to…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_10":"This reality likely works like the other Spheres. There’s a Reactor or a similar device running it. We find it and change its programming.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_11":"But we’re not “Engineers” yet. We’re unable to affect the Nexus’ technology!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_12":"I’m done waiting for authorization from a hologram. All of us have dealt with unknown, ultra-advanced alien technology before. It is par for the course!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story02_13":"I’m tuning my tricorder to the Reactors already in our possession. Let’s find whatever is controlling the Caretaker’s little trial.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story03_01":"And here you are at last, through a combination of faith, determination and…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story03_02":"Yes yes, we know: cunning. Way ahead of you, Confucius.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story03_03":"Correct, you have circumvented the directed path and have tapped into the Nexus itself. Although you will find that the more major constructs of it are not as easy to tamper with.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story03_04":"And now, there only remains...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story03_05":"No! No more trials! We have proven our abilities, and there is no time.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m4_story03_06":"Regardless of your perception of readiness, the trials for an aspiring Engineer are a binary requirement. They must all be complete before you are able to engage the Reality Engine.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle01_01":"Federation!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle01_02":"We mean you no harm, we’re from the U.S.S. Art--","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle01_03":"Apprehend them! Tomalak and Sela will have our hides if we let them reach the beacon!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle01_post_01":"Doesn’t seem like these Romulans are open to dialogue and reason…","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle06_post_01":"I wish we could have resolved that differently.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle06_post_02":"She seemed certain the Federation is working against the Romulans.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle06_post_03":"Perhaps catching up to her commander will give more insight.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle06_post_04":"They certainly seem sure we're spying on them!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle09_post_01":"He’s subdued.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle09_post_02":"I'm not sure stunning him is what the test was about...","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle09_post_03":"He did say at times you must show the other side the strength of your convictions!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_battle09_post_04":"Well... I don't see a sign we failed, so I supposed you're right.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_01":"Stop right there.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_02":"We're not here to fight.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_03":"You're a Klingon. Of course you're here to fight.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_04":"Fella has a point.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_05":"Hmph.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_reaction01_01":"We are here to open a dialogue.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_reaction01_02":"Bah! You are here to sabotage the beacon. You are too late in any case, Tomalak already departed with the data.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_reaction01_03":"Stand down. Let us walk away and we'll do the same.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_reaction01_04":"We wouldn’t waste precious breath on you. The data we obtained will expose the Federation as the treacherous snakes you are! (they beam out)","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_reaction01_05":"Wait. Did a Romulan just call us treacherous snakes? That's one for the books.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_reaction02_01":"We're not looking for trouble.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration01_reaction02_02":"And yet you’re here, and you’ve found it!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration02_01":"More Romulans. And another sensor beacon.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration02_02":"Federation. How... unsurprising. Come here to hide traces of your treachery?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration02_03":"I have no idea what you're talking about.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration02_reaction01_01":"You claim to know nothing about the Federation ships that have been regularly slipping across the neutral zone and spying on my people?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration02_reaction01_02":"We have hard evidence of your kind breaking countless treaties.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration02_reaction01_03":"Let us review the evidence and attempt to make sense of this. Would you rather try than start an all-out war?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration02_reaction01_04":"I won’t deny you’re making sense. I will allow you to meet with my commanding officer.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration02_reaction01_05":"I doubt you'll be able to convince him, though. He's dealt with your kind before.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration02_reaction02_01":"Do you take us for fools? We have evidence of Federation ships slipping across the neutral zone and spying on our people.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration02_reaction02_02":"That is against Federation values. Lay down your weapons now, or we will force them out of your hands!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_01":"It looks like the Romulan commander is ahead of us, ready to depart.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_02":"We need to stop him before he does!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction01_01":"There must be a way we can reach an agreement here!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction01_02":"I will not fall for whatever ruse you are concocting.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction01_03":"Our sensor beacon has evidence that elements within Section 31 have been spying on my people for over a decade.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction01_04":"As a loyal servant of the empire, it's my duty to report this violation to the High Council!","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction01_05":"As much as it pains me to admit... you might be right. Section 31 has never been the most trustworthy of organizations.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction01_06":"You… you admit this? Hmmm, I’ll listen. What do you propose?","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction01_07":"Give us a copy of your data. We'll report it to Starfleet. If it's true, they'll investigate further and reply along proper diplomatic channels.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction01_08":"You realize your copy could be altered.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction01_09":"As could yours. We're asking you to trust we'll deal with any potential breach of diplomacy.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction01_10":"Very well. But I will not stay to converse any further. Take the data.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction02_01":"Halt. We can't let you leave with Federation intel.","Data_GSCutSceneDialogue_e7_m5_exploration03_reaction02_02":"Oh?
